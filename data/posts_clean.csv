before all you humble people get on here and say “i wasn’t good at anything” i know there was one thing you were just a little better at than everything else relatively  whether that was strength conditioning gymnastics etcfor me i was shocked at my ability to learn the gymnastics movements  i had never done gymnastics a day in my life and can do   and consecutive muscleups  but on the flip side i am still terrible at pretty much all the olympic lifts  i thought that would be one of my strengths before i started but it’s turned out to be a massive weakness  was anyone else kind of surprised at what they were good ator had an easier time learning,crossfit
i am starting crossfit again and general weightlifting after taking a break due to a lower back injury muscle strain and then triathlon training i am starting from zero using crossfit linchpin at home which has been awesome because there is no ego involved with chasing heavier weights than i could handle which was how i injured myself in the first place that being said i am concentrating on improving my squat specifically my back squat because that was also the movement i injured myself with i have been looking at all of the past weightlifting belt posts and seeing a trend of only using a belt at percentages over  however all of the weights that i am moving are usually over that because i am not lifting a lot and i only have a barbell and a pair of  and  i think i know the answer already but should i use a weightlifting belt to help enforce the bracing effect and add supportconfidence to my back squat my main focus is building technique before adding weight,crossfit

before every new launch there is usually an ig post that says “sign up and enter to win a free pair through the link in our bio” have you or anyone else you know ever actually won nobull claims that they email the winner prior to release however they have never announced them to the public nor shared any post from winners to add more even following the common hashtags iamnobull nobull nobullproject and etc there aren’t any people posting them either which seems off to meobviously it’s a marketing method and a way to build up site metrics maybe i’m just putting to much thought into it but i’m generally curious if there truly is anyone out there that have legit won a pair through this,crossfit
i know the title am i right we had a young lady just start doing crossfit at our box i programmed a thruster  rep max as she was doing her thruster she let one rip she immediately turned a shade of red i had never seen in real life a look of horror came over her face she then started apologizing i told her it wasnt her fault and to put the bar down i went over and got an allen wrench and then pretended to fix the bar she asked what i was doing and i told her that this bar had been making weird noises all day and i just wanted to make sure it was safe for her to pick up again i told her that sometimes if the bars arent properly maintenance that they can make a metal on metal sound or something similar to a crunching sound i then did a few thrusters with her bar and told her it was safe to continue the look on her face was priceless a mixture of relief embarrassment and happiness because she obviously had something to blame the noise on she went on to hit a  lb pr and over all i think i handled that well  story for your day,crossfit

may not be the best place to ask this but at least some cf boxes my be facing the same dilemma my box is facing  we are located in a coldish state winter days are typically  and  some colder and in the midst of this pandemic we keep an entire side of our space open to the elements to have as much outside air coming in as possible  so its cold really cold in early am and late pm classes when theres no sun  trying to come up with a cost effective solution to bring the temp up while still getting loads of outside airflow  just enough to take the edge off not looking to turn the place into a sauna  anyone go to a gym that solved this problem  anyone have suggestions  well tough it out if we have to but finding a way to warm the room up to even  degrees even while getting a constant flow of  degree outside air would be a game changer  and of course budget matters  things are tough all over  thanks for any suggestions,crossfit
i have been doing crossfit since the summer i started after being overweight and depressed after splitting up with my wife i decided it was time to at least attempt to get back into shape to help me not feel like shit all the time when i first started i absolutely dreaded going to class because i was so out of shape that the warmups would leave me out of breath i couldn’t finish any wod without at least severely scaling if i was even able to finish at all well as the weeks passed i went from  days a week to  and i’ve been going  a week consistently for a couple months now and i’ve noticed something recently i don’t get the sympathetic “just try your best” most of the time anymore and it’s more like “cmon keep moving” and i actually really appreciate it i’m still overweight mainly due to diet but i have still lost a decent amount of weight over the last few months it’s nice to see how much progress i have made by going consistently over the last couple months i absolutely love being pushed to my limits and being surprised to what my body can actually do it feels so good going from an obese person always being told “just do what you can” because i was in such poor physical health to “cmon man push harder” since i am someone who does better while being pushed by coaches and other members it feels great to finally somewhat be expected to finish every workout and i can thank all of my coaches for positively pushing me to my limits mostly for cardio they don’t push me to do more weights during lifts fyi every day i feel more fit and i just know there’s no other way i would’ve gotten to this point without the help of my box it has done wonders for my physical and mental health in just a few months,crossfit

when the rona shut our gym down in march i had been consistently going  days a week and lost a substantial amount of fat and gained a substantial amount of muscle felt fantastic and was just in a great state i was obsessed with being healthy even signed up for a festivus games covid hits all that goes to shit start eating like an asshole and not working out even though the gym let me borrow a kettle bell and dball they also provided at home programming gym opens back up in may per our governors guidelines and i don’t go for  months he would text me every now and then to check up on me i never once though about cancelling i liked the option probably why planet fitness does so well the reason i didn’t go back was because i was so anxious not about being around people or anything  we are well spaced and can be in open air but because i literally thought i was going to die like literally i was so worried about being out of shapeeven though i’ve already started from scratch once the sleeping in was also nice fast forward to last friday i texted him and asked if monday would be a good day to start he said of course and told me they would scale it i honestly didn’t believe him he literally was right there with me the whole day scaled everything for me and made sure i was ok i didn’t tell him why i hadn’t been back but i feel like he knew and of course when i was walking out said ‘see you tomorrow’ with a grin longish post but had to brag and also excited to be back on the light side with you folks,crossfit

i just joined a new crossfit gym after an  month hiatus due to covid and my worries about that this new gym’s owner assured me that everyone has to wear masks no face shields as they are mandatory still with some hesitation i decided to do a free trial class at the trial class every single person had a mask on and the distancing measures are actually pretty impressive there each person has their own  area i decided to sign up right after that class two days later i go back for my second class and of the  people attending the class one person had just a face shield and it was upside down and  others had their masks below their nose the whole class i wanted to say something but i just didn’t feel comfortable since i just joined the gym the coaches did not say anything it also hurt my workout a bit because i was preoccupied about the situation the whole time am i right for feeling uncomfortable about this should i speak to the owner should i just ask the attendees to fix their masks i get it that working out with a mask sucks but it’s better than getting covid,crossfit

i dont know if there is a dedicated ask crossfit subreddit my goal is to become a faster runner and at the same time be efficient in muscular endurance for those  rep wods like the murph i really want to join a crossfit gym as well what intrigued me about crossfit is how the athletes run  miles and lift heavy plus having all this muscular endurance when i barely see them run is it because the wods they do at the gym help them with aerobic conditioning even without running or they balance running and do wods because if i were to achieve something similar my plan for a training routine is day  wod  easy run day  speed runday  wod day  speed runday  easy long run   restbut let me know what ya’ll think,crossfit
i got into an argument about who had a more impressive crossfit resume so i put this together a points system ranking of the best alltime male crossfit games athletes hope to do the womans side as well we all know mat and rich are the  and  but who is the  what about the top  thought it would be fun to try to answer that tell me whatcha thinkhowd i do it note   what competitions did i consideronly the crossfit games were considered i think there is an argument for considering things like the open and regionalssanctionals i decided against it as the games are the pinnacle of the sport that is where we ultimately judge success and failurenote   all the games or just moderni considered tiering games by year so that performance in the  games is more valuable than the  games its quite clear there is a different level of fitness now compared to the early days however deciding how to tier each year was too difficult while its clear there is a huge difference between the very early and modern games its not clear where the line is how much more impressive is a  games win vs  i dont know how to answer that what i decided to do was only consider the  games and on the    games are just too different from today this isnt perfect graham holmbergs  place in  is a completely different accomplishment than any of frasers but we do this in other sports too we talk about bill russel and jerry west as alltime greats when in reality if they were transported to the modernday nba lebron would dominate them so take jason kahlipa and chis speilers ranking with a grain of salt i also only considered athletes who had competed at the games at least  times sorry medieros who would have tied for    point systemthere is a tone of different ways to do this i prioritized wins podium finishes and top  finishes the grouping towards the bottom is mostly due to laziness made things a lot easier here is the                                                                                                m fraser	            r froning	            b smith	                    s panchik	             b gudmundsson	     p vellner	             j khalipa	             n olsen	                     b fikowski	             g holmberg	             j bridges	             d bailey	                     c sager	                     s kwant	                     j heppner	             l hogberg	             k kasperbaur	     c speiler	             j koski	                     a anderson	            ,crossfit

hi everyone im looking for practical tipsadvice for making progress as it pertains to mental fortitude in my training its my biggest limiting factor and pushing through it isnt helpfulbeen doing crossfit for about  years now started as a completely unathletic person part of why i started was because i have some pretty serious perfectionism and negative self talk issues i wanted to force myself to do something i would suck at and of course i graduated college and knew my metabolism wouldnt keep up for much longer and i should probably start taking care of my bodyin a lot of ways the three years have worked alongside other effort ive been taking to expose myself to what i call voluntary discomfort but now that im not a complete rookie and ive found i have a pretty natural inclination for oly lifts im starting to be really insanely upset with myself for not being as good as i think i should be ive gotten to a point where now during wods i pendulum swing from thinking i cant do this workoutwhats the point to ruthlessly berating myself for having those thoughts and struggling while the person next to me is flying through their pullups or i struggle to know if im scaling appropriately or sandbaggingi know this may sound ridiculous especially if youve always been an athlete or if youre very neurotypical im not being dramatic and i dont want pity im looking to see if anyone else has struggled with this and found somethings that have worked for them im sure im not the only one who could benefit from this conversation,crossfit

hi all im about  years into crossfit and one of my next goals is to feel comfortable and build on my snatch and overheard mobility right now its really challenging for me to put the barbell on its own over my head and get a full squat going   what steps can i take to work on feeling comfortable in that position what will help me get more flexible and add more weight eventually thanks for your help,crossfit
i started crossfit in my  with absolutely  background in anything athletic  i tweaked my backshouldersarms multiple times and it took me  years to understand how much flexibility helps as mine was hot garbage while the gyms were shut down i really focused on shoulder and back mobility and sweet jesus does it ever help when you can get in a proper position where your muscles dont feel like they are about to tear how much easier a squat is when the bar is actually inline with your center of gravity and youre not constantly fighting against being pulled forward or keeping your elbows high i remember not being able to ohs an empty bar now its a favorite lift because its something most people consider difficult that i do really well i like to think of lifting as    flexibility obviously without good flexibility you cant have good technique how many times did a coach try and move my body into a proper position and my body just couldnt do iti really wish i had focused waaay more on flexibility from the start as  years in my strength has gone through the roof but my  suffer because my best clean is a muscle clean my best snatch a muscle snatch  yes my flexibility is better but im not close to being done yet gowod tells me my posterior chain mobility is  go me now  years in i need to learn how to get comfortable with squat snatch and squat clean like im new off the street because only in the last couple of months has my front rack gotten to the point where i can squat that way the feeling where a year ago i hit a  front squat but my back screamed at me for days after and i was seriously a year where my body refused to allow me to front squat at all without feeling seriously compromised a few weeks ago i did a few sets of  and worked up to  and it felt good like magic all because of my positioning the difference between fighting the bar to stop it from rolling down my arms to it just sitting cradled on my shoulders effortlesslyim at the gym  days a week and this year is the first time where nothing hurts the bad kind of hurt as all crossfitters hurt because im not pushing my muscles and joints to their limits this was a very long public service announcement to focus on your mobility every bit as much as you work on your technique and strength as its every bit as important probably more ,crossfit

i am currently watching event  of the  crossfit games and the form of majority of the athletes is horrendous noah olsen has terrible form in squaring strict shoulder and deadlift all the females knees were basically clapping during the squats besides improper form i highly doubt any of these athletes are natty this leads to having regular crossfit gym goers trying to lift a number rather than focusing on proper form and injury prevention and trying to attain an unattainable physical appearance,crossfit

i suck at cardio and have tried a bunch of things to deliberately change my breathing patterns i am not sure ive hit on anything that works reliably but one thing i have had some success with is belly breathingi think i am naturally a chest breather and i have always felt my cardio capacity suffers as a result i just naturally take fast shallow breaths unless i consciously try to do otherwise even at rest or while sleeping as far as i can tell i will sometimes deliberately try to belly breathe during workouts and i think it really does help this is particularly difficult for me with anything that involves the core or bending over for example most any barbell lift or toes to bar but when for example running i feel like it makes a difference but ive never been able to quantify iti was watching nfl over the weekend and some players had cutoff jerseys and i could literally see their breathing in their mid to lower abdomen which just never happens with mei wonder if anyone has any experience with this trying to change their breathing patterns during workouts or any exercises or techniques for doing so  i have even thought of going to some kind of clinic to have my cardio capacity measured wonder if anyone has done something like that and what the results were,crossfit

so ive been doing crossfit regularly for about  months now while i enjoy the weight loss and looking better i think the functional progress outside of the box has been the best measure of progressi also do bjj and although ive been doing it for a while there was about a  second cap on how long i could scramble for position before just gassing out now im outscrambling guys half my age not every time but enough to realize theres a differenceand although im not into running so much i do it as an active rest or if my coach tells me to about a month ago i did  miles taking about  minutes walking probably a mile of it yesterday i did a  in just under  minutes i realize its not a blistering pace but considering i couldnt even run more than a mile straight im pretty happy anyway just throwing this out there for the new folks who maybe are wondering if there have been any benefits stick with it it pays off,crossfit
why arent strict pullups more represented on the games or opens maybe more represented is an overstatement i didnt even see them in the last couple of years correct me please if im wrongwhats the real problem officiating the correct form i think it it more difficult to officiate the regular crossfit pullup where they maybe maybe have the tip of the chin above the bar most of the time  maybe it is the issue what would be the allowed amount of kipping because people would start to kip on the strict pullups when they are ehaustedi think the crossfit pullups are atleast  times easier than the strict ones and i dont understand why we dont see the strict pullups on the crossfit eventsserious discussion please dcheers,crossfit

a big thing we talked about in this sub this weekend was how no one seemed to be pushing tiamat for the wins in certain events but i rewatched some events and kinda thought transitions played a big rolesome examples i can think of off the top of my head during the  event tia setting her bells in the middle of the rig which is how she beat katrin in the round of  happy star for the last few hill sprints brooke wells did have to run farther as the sprints moved more to the left of the field of play but she wasnt moving faster to compensate for that swin n stuff getting in and out of the ghds to the med ball slams in and out of the pool onto the bikeghdthis is all to ask sometimes i wonder when its not a matter of fitness how is the rest of the field fumbling transitions like that tia and mat definitely have the gameplay of competitive crossfit down and its interesting to me that its a metaskill that is not as sharp across the field at that levelthere are other examples i can think of from other years too  the clean ladder strongmans fear  two stroke pull  first cut the standard,crossfit
this years crossfits games was plan boring it lacked excitement the competition the feel and the spirit of past games it was bland and over after day  it went from my most looked forward sporting event to something south of disappointment if this format continues say goodbye to the crossfit brand as we know it,crossfit
i am a huge fan of dave castro what he has done for the sport and games is amazing his programming for years was excellent with both the unknown aspects balance of fitness across many domains and fun to watchness all in a delicate harmony however the past couple years have simply not been acceptable the idea of cutting an entire field after a single event or imposing harsh penalties for stepping on a line may simply have been a poor judgement calls didnt seem fair to the idea of broadly testing fitness this year the last minute additions of the  was not in keeping with the spirit of the gamesbut the absolute worst and unforgivable choice was the twist ending of the trail run to have them run the course again in reverse he deliberately misled them about the event itself that is undoubtedly a great mental test of fortitude if you were training but terrible for a competition this is completely different than the chaos event when athletes new theyd make their way across a field with a variety of exercises but not now reps and exercises in advance the unknown aspect then was known what if at the end of the  meter sprintsledsprint he had said no just kidding that isnt the event now go row a half marathonhe should absolutely go back to training navy seals and the entire sport is in debt to all he has done but it is time to pass the baton of games directorship to someone else,crossfit

just for funif you were designing a test for the fittest on earth and were specifically doing  workout to test each of the  elements of fitness what would you program for the  workoutsso to be clear the total  would be  workouts long each one trying to isolate one of the elements of fitness  not necessarily trying to make it interesting to watch but the best test you can think of for each elementthe  elements are  cardiovascular  respiratory endurance – the ability of body systems to gather process and deliver  stamina – the ability of body systems to process deliver store and utilize  strength – the ability of a muscular unit or combination of muscular units to apply  flexibility – the ability to maximize the range of motion at a given  power – the ability of a muscular unit or combination of muscular units to apply maximum force in minimum  speed – the ability to minimize the time cycle of a repeated  coordination – the ability to combine several distinct movement patterns into a singular distinct  agility – the ability to minimize transition time from one movement pattern to  balance – the ability to control the placement of the body’s center of gravity in relation to its support  accuracy – the ability to control movement in a given direction or at a given intensityill give my take in the comments looking forward to seeing the interesting things you all come up with,crossfit
if you train bjj and also do crossfit i’d love to hear your experiences how you structure you training week pros and cons of doing both why started training bjj in the first place or any other experience you feel like sharing i’ve been working as a level  trainer for about  and have been doing bjj for nearly  i’m currently in the process of starting a bjj program at the crossfit i work at which is why i’m looking for other’s experiences with both sports,crossfit
pretty entertaining games this year despite the format changes etc  i definitely missed having more competitors but it was nice to see everyone competing at once as far as a viewing experience goeswith that said i found i was constantly annoyed by the commentary on winning events in cg games  for instance the commentators would say something like this is mats  event win at the cf games for his career making that number up dont know what his current tally is  i take literally nothing away from mat or tia for winning the  games  they were very clearly head and shoulders above the rest and there is really no argument anyone can make to the contrary but you cant weigh the event wins from this year the same as prior years  when you only have  other competitors in the field its much easier to win any given event  winning an event against  competitors is much more impressive because you are beating people who might be specialists or for whom this might be a wheelhouse workout  im not saying the  other people in the field didnt deserve to be there but counting these wins alongside winning double dt or mary from last year is just sillyobviously none of this matter in the grand scheme but i hope they have some way of recognizing how much harder it is to win events in a field of  or the larger fields from last year,crossfit

does anyone have advice to get abs to engage my biggest weakness is my core i never seem to make any ground with them doing core exercises in wods just feels like a total waste of time  actually counter productive as all i can feel is my lower back doing the work sometimes they’ll engage in the first round of an exercise but i just lose that by the second round sometimes randomly they’ll be brilliant and i can feel them working sometimes they may as well not exist i can also barely do dead bugs without my back arching weirdly i don’t have severe apt has anyone else been in this boat and is there a way out i feel like i just can’t get out of the hole i put myself in after neglecting my core for so long 😂 any advice is appreciated thanks,crossfit
hey guysso i recently started crossfit but have been working out for many years mostly hiit and a little weights but not consistentlyi have always struggled to get into a deep squat if my feet are in a regular squat stance i can bend my knees literally an inch i have to be in basically a sumo squat to get down at all my crossfit coach has given me some good mobility work for this and i am working on it but it is a slow process and i am not expecting huge changes any time soon as i have been trying to sort out my squat on and off since the dawn of time anyway someone mentioned to me getting some weightlifting shoes to lift my heel as i am able to squat when i lift my heel using plates or what not i am guessing if i did they would be suitable only for lifts and not for the wods where we have running is that right or can you get ones that lift you a bit and are suitable for both im not really sure where to start to be honest so if anyone has any thoughts or has been through the same i would appreciate some help,crossfit

some people have criticized that we dont see enough competition for first place in the events and that seems to be true few people are really going all out and collapsing after the events it happens but its rare people who you would expect could win an event dont even seem to tryi think the main reason is the way the prize money is structured theres money to be made for your placement in the games not the events so if you cant win the games it makes more sense to game the system and play for second its better to finish every event second than to win an event and burn yourself out for the next three thats why we dont see people going all out and why the games have become homogenized with few specialists and few outstanding individual performancesso what if that got flipped on its head my idea was to reward individual event performance what if winning the games gave the athlete a prize of  second gets  third gets  but wining an event was  with  for second the total money handed out would roughly stay the same for the organizers but it would be spread around more and winning each event would come with its own rewardathletes would be willing to really leave it all on the field because winning two events would be better than to come in second overall so each athlete would have to push themselves to really make the events where they could win count  we would see the return of specialists strength monsters and endurance runners people who would get fit enough overall to qualify and specifically come in to win their part of the games and be rewarded for that performance  and we might see some changes at the top because a mat or tia might really have to retool their training faced with the  effort of specialists and people willing to race them to the finish line and leave it all out on the field they would be faced with the choice to just win the games maybe by placing second and third in each event while the specialists got a mix of first places and bottom placements for a low amount of prize money or fight for some wins to up their earnings at the risk of maybe burning out and losing the gamewhat do you think of that idea good plan to make the events more fun or a move that is against the spirit of trying to find the most wellrounded athlete,crossfit

i just can’t see the difference between “ burpees each minuteevery minute” and “ burpees every minute on the minute” i know one can say for short “ minutes emom” but one could also say “ minutes em” i am a non native english speaker but as i understand it the part “on the minute” only confuses more instead of clarifying and in my country usually the coach spends more time explaining what “emom” means and it ends up with him saying “x reps each minute” am i missing something,crossfit

as beginner i am a bit confused when i take a look at benchmark wods but as well at the wods i encounter in the classes theres a variety of people in a class with different sizes and bodyweights etc but they are supposed to perform the exercises with the same weight only separated by gender so i was wondering why not working more often with bw percentages when it comes to barbell exercises for example wouldnt it be easier to compare wod performances with classmates this way and also it appears more reasonable to me to track my own progress because my bodyweight might change over the years of training and therefore former strength values are not useful to look at anymorei already asked ony of my coaches but he actually didnt know what to answer btw i know that wods are being scaled but that is not the point of my question and sorry i am not a native speaker,crossfit

what are they doing so right in training that the others arent the gulf is enormous nowthoughts,crossfit
watching brooke wells send it in event  and actually try to topple tia is very respectable looks like everyone else just wants to get  and are  playing the long gametoo tactically thats my take anyway,crossfit
mat is on  with adler on  and tia is on  with katrin on  the gap between first and second is crazy this top five have access to all advantages  coaches nutrition equipment etc what is it that can make them dominate so much i don’t know if there’s a real answer and if it was obvious then everyone would be doing iti just can’t believe the gap,crossfit
ive been watching the crossfit games and feeling very inspired ive been doing  and bft for a couple years now and pt since iso my question ive built up a fair amount of strength in the pt sessions  times per week focusing on compound lifts i feel going back to the  strength days would be a backwards step but worry about the nominated weights for crossfit wods is there a scaling process fr weight ranges or is it expected the more mature should be able to lift as much as the youngsters,crossfit

is it just me or is there a difference in time between different judges and when they clear the athletes to move to the next movement or stage of an eventone prime example is the amount of time the athletes spent at the top of the rep during the speed snatch it seems that most if not all the athletes demonstrated control at the top but still some werent cleared as fast as others now this maybe after most at  second delay but in that event that split second difference could be important especially looking at the time difference between tia and katrin,crossfit

hi everyoneso im   and around  wanting to get down to around  and am interested in hearing some stories of bigger athletes having some success at comps as well as what you think the maximum height and weight to compete at an elite level would be say finishing towards the top of regional levelobviously with having a bigger rom and carrying extra weight it could make it more difficult but then i guess it helps with monostructural events ski erging rowing etc along with mental strength playing a big part i know theres been a few bigger guys like aja barto but feel like he maybe might not have had as much success if he was competing now and a few other bigger guys like brent fikowski garett fisher etc have there been any others thanks for your opinions,crossfit
please justify your answer in the most amazing way,crossfit
anyone heard or seen anything about the possibility of games used equipment sales i know typically it’s sold inperson and what is left is sold online i was hoping it would mostly all be sold online this year but can’t find any information about it,crossfit
i have been doing crossfit for about one month i like it it’s fun i typically go  days a week as i powerlift  days a weeki don’t understand how people get better at it like the wods seem to be random exercises i know people at my box track the progress through our app but i still don’t get it what kind of training do the heavy hitters do outside of wods is it olympic lifting for strength powerliftingcould someone please explain crossfit explain progressing and explain what heavy hitter crossfit people do outside of regular wodsthanks,crossfit
i dont care if you love crossfit or you yell zeroooo all day to it there are so few sports out there which treat the televised spectacle of the best in the world competing with equal respect and time for both genderscrossfit should always be respected for this and applauded outside of track and field and we can discuss that too i struggle to think of other sports that do it in this way,crossfit
i can no longer overhead snatch dislocated shoulders what’s a good alternative exercise,crossfit
this a rant and something i’ve noticed with the influx of new people since my box reopened in may a lot of people not even necessarily new members are cheating reps andor lying on their scores i noticed it when someone was cutting short the programmed rest in a metcon and it got me suspicious started talking to other members about it and i wasn’t the only one who noticed it personally i don’t really get validation anymore from being near the top of the leaderboard but it’s annoying to see people say they rx’d a workout when they scaled reps or note on the whiteboard that they got a lower time than they actually did i’m fully aware that they are doing themselves a disservice but it’s really frustrating for those of us who worked for months to over a year to regularly rx workouts the coaches recognize when people are cheating but it’s one of those things where they simply clarify what rx standards are without really enforcing it i’m wondering how often this happens at other boxes and what is done to curb it,crossfit

in his interview after event  mat fraser said he likes to listen to podcasts rather than music when working out in his garage what are your guesses about his favorite podcastsim guessing the alarmist is right up there its all about incredible failures in history since he doesnt know about failure personally he has to find creative ways to learn about what other humans go through,crossfit

i have recently been thinking about trying crossfit  i might be one of the few people thats lost weight over quarantine almost  lbs mostly through diet  though i feel like i lost a little bit of muscle along with the weight and would like to get stronger  i also regularly train in martial arts karate specifically  i currently take karate classes  times a week  and its generally a pretty good workout obviously the main focus is not always conditioning but technique  also part of my desire to be in better physical shape is because i may test for black belt sometime next year who knows what the world will be like by then and the testing is particularly physically arduous and lasts about  hours  i would like to make it through it without feeling like im going to diemy hesitation with crossfit is that im not looking for another hobby  i help teach karate and generally help out a lot at the school so that is the focus of my attention when it comes to my free time  it seems like for a lot of people crossfit is to them what karate is to me but im just looking for a workout and id probably only be able to go once or twice a week  is it worth it for me  im not super great at selfmotivating at the gym thats one of the reasons i started taking martial arts so the idea of someone laying out the workout appeals to me  im also interested in being able to lift more  im just not sure the cost of going to one of the gyms is worth it if im not planning on getting as into it,crossfit
checked the games site the general web and reddit unable to locate the breakdown of lifts only totals could someone share the crossfit total individual lift results from stage  event ,crossfit
i love seeing simple brutally effective workouts like the corn sack hill sprint and it has me wondering how folks would incorporate these into their training i have a large hill near my house that is easily accessible forthis type of workoutis it better to go light and be able to almost jog or better to go heavier and basically do a fast walk should it take the place of an interval type day or would you do it instead of a long endurance type day how many would you do and how much rest in betweenthis seems like a question for uthegainslab his programming is great btw,crossfit
ive tried googling and cant find exactly why there might be a scientific reason but seeing some of the amazing female athletes out there i cant understand why they are different,crossfit

when i first started working out at my box i had just slightly messed up my knee probably from being sore all the time and from running while heavyi’ve lost  lbs since then but a few weeks ago i twerked my knee again the other knee this time we had a leg heavy week and then had a wod with sumo deadlifts deadlifts etc and a  mike run after halfway during the run i felt my knee tingling and part of my hamstring feeling numbnow my knee doesn’t hurt but it feels really wrong my coach is telling me to workout and come in and modify but when i came in for a leg workout even the modified exercises feel weirdtldr yes nothing hurts but it feels extremely stiff it’s been about  weeks the same now every day after i wake up from light stretching it feels very warm hot or burning even and stiff i tell people it feels like there’s a rubber band in my knee that feels taut i have no idea what’s going on and i’m afraid of making it worse,crossfit
there’s one coach at my gym who will text me a few hours before a class if i’m the only one enrolled to tell me the class has been cancelled when i signed up i was told to book classes early since they’ll cancel them if nobody signs up my feeling is that he’s just being lazy and avoiding coming in for one participant but i don’t know the owners well enough to feel comfortable broaching the subject any advice,crossfit

happy games eve yall everyone of course works out to different music from metal to rap to country for me it depends on the kind of workout im going for ill listen to more chilled country if im just working on slower lifts for instance for years though ive tried to find music that gets me pumped during a metcon makes me feel like im in the heat of a comp but isnt too violent and aggressive just strikes that right balance between good music that swells at the right time to get me fired up when i need a little more juicei used to put the fittest docs on when doing high intense cardio for instance as they always seemed to nail the action star build up music starts slow to a big epic finish but its not a soundtrack thats available i think its heebs bro that did itanywhofinallyi come across audiomachine if you havent listened to them absolutely do so its instrumental action film intense superhero style shit not in your face enough to be constantly distracting but when it builds up at least for me its fucking awesome and really pumps me upfew recommendations to start with if these dont do it for you its probably not for youalbum  ascendance their best imo but they have tons of work out therestand out tracks   centrifuge slow burner kicks in around  if you cant imagine nailing fran or a power clean pr to it then you have no soul access point  through the darkness kick in around  dauntless kick in  leap of faith personal fave starts pretty gentle but stay with itstarts to ramp up around  then again  it always always fires me up last  songs ninurta and conquering olympus are both a bit darker in toneits a fantastic album to listen to non shuffled it flows great honourable mention as my  favourite album of theirs is volturnus and then cinematix which is a little more experimental and almost tronlike at timesgive them a shot hope you enjoy and feel free to share any similar style albumsbands,crossfit

preface im high the first crossfit workout i did was death by  meters so its only right that the hardest event in history be where i started cause im aight i got a  deadlift  i squat that i dont know i think it would be neat thing and its possible atalanta raced dudes if you won you got that sweet sweet prize but if you lost you died dude this would be an insane event who the fuck is gonna stop for those that dont know death by  meters is    meter sprint first minute  next minute and so on its more mental than anything and that would be brutal because no one would stop wed see it go to at least  minutes and it makes sense if you lose you die and its such an old school workout and thats the theme i really think that could be it also it fits perfectly into the narrative of my life because im moving on from crossfit fuck cardio powerlifter now,crossfit

hi everyone i have a question about continuing to push yourself when you are completely out of breath and your heartrate is sky high yesterday i did  rounds for time  alternating db  db goblet  alternating db snatchneedless to say it was tough even though on paper it doesnt look so bad but  rounds in i was just gassed i have only been doing cf for about  months but man i was barely breathing my hr was  and i was taking like  second breaks after each exercise all of this while others around me admittedly far more fit than me were pushing through and almost going unbroken when i look at my hr monitor and see  feel like i need to break so my hr doesnt go any higher and i can catch some breathbut do i really need this is it safe to just push through the suck and try to go unbroken i know i am capable of more than i was pushing myself yesterday but i dont want to push so hard that i end up falling over or something embarassing like that lol any tips on pushing through the suck would help tremendouslythanks,crossfit

so i recently moved from the midwest to the south the town i moved to has one box within like a  mile radius it’s pretty large far larger than the gym i’m coming from the gym i went to had a wide variety of athletes i have only been doing crossfit for around  months and maybe can rx half the workouts at my old gym this gym is a different animal this gym is insanely competitive and the wodsclasses are “custom” made by the owner for the most part there’s a couple guys and girls who competed in previous games years back and still a few ranked in the top  or so currentlyso at my old gym we would warm up for around  minutes then get into the wod that would last  min then stretch together as a group with the time leftthis gym has you come in early to warm yourself up and there’s lifts before each wod like i was excited to try awful annie but we had to do a variety of squats for  minutes that left me already tiredthe people here are incredibly kind they aren’t competitive in a bad way and are all like a family but i’m leaving workouts to the point that i can barely move my body even scaled i couldn’t lift my arms for nearly two days and they’re telling me to come in and work through iti want to keep to doing crossfit but if there’s no where else around what do you recommend i literally asked the owner head coach if i can skip the before wod lifts to stretch and warm up since i don’t plan on become a competitor i just like doing wods to stay active and fit but he said very nicely that they want to the whole class on the same page does anyone have any advice that i have maybe not thought of yet,crossfit

so every video i see on how to install the weighted plates to the plate carrier shows using the laser cut plates which are much wider and thinner than the cast plates so the straps wrapping up from underneath the plates holding them in place and keeping them from falling down easily grab the platethe problem i have is i bought the cast plates which are more narrow and the straps the wrap underneath cannot both catch the plate  since the edges of the plate actually taper one of the straps always slides up that tapered edge  twice now ive had a plate comes loose during a workout and completely drop down out of both straps luckily stayed in the vesthas anyone figured out a workaround for this  the cast plates say they are compatible with the  vest but again i havent seen a single video showcasing them used and it really just doesnt seem to fit well with the strapping provided  disappointed these are recommended because it really doesnt seem like they should be,crossfit

ive been thinking about posting for a while but decided today to make a post im not trying to sway people away from crossfit but wanted to make sure people listen to their bodies and dont overdo your workouts in late january after crossfit i came home and made dinner then went for a shower normal routine about halfway through the shower started to experience visual changes and decreased function of the lower extremities i suspected it was low blood sugar and being fatigued i quickly got out of the shower and fell to the floor with my vision going black for  seconds i was able to walk downstairs and have some water and an orange around  anne awoke to find me moving my extremities erratically she noticed i was moving his right side less than his left side at this point i was unable to speak or move my mouth ems was initiated and i was transported to the hospital i underwent a head ct upon arrival to the hospital although the ct was unremarkable a ctangio revealed a distal  occlusion i was a candidate for intravenous tissuetype plasminogen activator iv tpa i was taken to ir and found to have a carotid dissection i underwent thrombectomy and carotid angioplasty with stent placement thereafter he was admitted to the micuper the neurologist i tore my right side carotid artery monday doing deadlifts then doing the clean and jerks two days later caused the scab to become loosened thus causing the stroke recovery has been tough for many reasons and covid has made it very difficult physically im back to normal and have lost a ton of muscle and weight the worst part is my vocabulary and speech patterns are back to  keep safe and trust your body,crossfit
hi everyone im still pretty new to crossfit like  maybe  months in so far im enjoying it and have definitely seen progress even exercises im not comfortable with at first are getting betterthe one exception is the overhead squat ive had some shoulder injuries in the past and i cant seem to get my body to listen when it comes to using weight i practice the movement with a pvc pipe and can do it no problem but as soon as theres any weight even an empty bar i feel the bar come forward a little bit and bail on the movement i think its bc ive got some fear about hurting my shoulder but i cant figure out how to get past thisim stretching and doing mobility exercise every time i work out i know my shoulders have the range at this point i just cant put it together anyone ever had this issue and how did you overcome it,crossfit
right off i paid for the rental so its not on prime if youre asking im usually a fan of these docs and find them motivating but fittest was a little off to me i still liked it but just not as much as others it lacked personality in my opinion as the games took a more openly cut throat approach the change in format and company being a bit in disarray stole some of the viewing fun athletes you loved from the other docs were now cast aside in this evolution anyone have any thoughts,crossfit
hello all i hope my post is appropriatei just joined this sub and crossfit irlive been assigned a frosty as described above to be completed with a weight that is approximately my  mr when i asked about changing weight the teacher told me to break down the days into mini sets that i can do so the  becomes  sets of  hopefully in my opinion if the set is broken down in not find the exercise prescribed im doing  set of  so should i adjust the weight to complete the  reps set or should i per through the very heavy weight sets,crossfit

hi everyone i decided to start doing crossfit i was going to the gym for  years but i find it boring i was always interested about crossfit but i was just finding excuses why not to start like “this is not for me” this is the truth i want to be honestand now i have finally decided it i will start tomorrowmy question is that what do you recommend for me as a beginner i still would like to build some muscles because lets be honest mostly everyone wants to look a “little bit better” would you do some extra lifting after the wod sessions  probably i will get replies like”after a good wod you wouldn’t need anything else  ,crossfit
im having second thoughts about starting over with my box this local box is my first and i have been with them for over  months i paused for  because i injured my knee and other things that i had to prioritize at the time im not sure if the injury was from crossfit but i felt it at the end of the day after a wod my performance is still at a point where i am scared to try heavier weights worrying so much about hurting myself additionally im still not over being insecure that im still a beginner im by no means competitive and i know i just need to get over the insecurity for those of you that went through this send me your advice so i can work up the courage and determination to sign up for another month or two thanks,crossfit
i have a sunny fitness magnetic resistance spin bike it doesn’t have a dedicated monitor so i have to connect the extra wahoo sensors to my phone in order to see distancerpms however there is no way for me to capture power output i originally bought the bike to do occasional peloton workouts but i over estimated how frequent i would be doing such   i’m currently doing marcus filly’s persist program which incorporates biking i’m interested in replacing the spin bike with a bikeerg due to the build quality of the bike and the great performance monitor always having to connect the sensors to my phone and pulling up the app is an inconvenience  however i’m concerned about using the bike erg for the occasional peloton workouts would it be similar to a spin bike i’ve heard that bikeerg is pretty good as far as adjusting the levels of resistance good for long endurance workouts and also high intensity interval‘s with a higher damper setting does any one have experience on riding a spin bike and the bikeerg and you can compare the twoessentially i value the  monitor love it heard great things about the bikeerg but just concerned it will me from doing the occasional spin workouts,crossfit

hi ive been doing crossfit for a little over  years and have been very lucky to avoid most injuries throughout the years i started noticing some low back pain three weeks ago after a heavy front squat that normally wouldnt have been a problem i started experiencing what i thought was a hamstring strain i had mild to moderate pain when bending over and figured i could train through it a few days later i started experiencing shooting pain down the back of my leg and a cramping sensation i also experienced a water sensation two weeks ago i went to a sports medicine pt to diagnose it he believes xray and mri next week to confirm i am dealing with a bulged disc in my lumbar spine based on the progression of my symptoms and the lack of any muscle involvement when trying to recreate the pain i have no pain sitting or laying down only when i initially stand up or try to recreate a squat or deadlift motion i have taken the past  weeks off from the gym ive avoided any barbell movements any weighted exercise and any high impact exercise running jumping while i wait for my xray and mri results and further guidance from my pt what can i do to stay active and retain my muscle ive gained ive done crossfit for  years and as a naturally slender female it took me so long to build the quads biceps and traps that i have now has anyone dealt with a similar injury any safe exercises other than walking swimming or yoga,crossfit

so i had a random thought today and id pose it to people here i work in a profession that requires facemasks and got to wondering if you thought wearing facemasks makes you better at crossfit my theory is that your body adapts to something over your face so it is kind of akin to when people train for high elevations with breathing through a straw so i wonder if this works the same way for facemasks and crossfit thoughts,crossfit

with the temperature dropping and my desire to keep training at home instead of the gym my current biggest hurdle is the cold i’m hoping to keep training outdoors and in my garage as long as the temp is above freezing  my biggest hurdle with cold temps is that my pullup bar kettle bell and barbell immediately strip all of the heat out of my hands  i think gloves would help a bunch  has anyone found gloves that work on for barbell work or hanging off a bar  i have gloves that have been decent for burpees and hspu but they slip when really hanging onto things,crossfit

hi guys just wondering if i could get some opinions and experiencesso i really enjoy crossfit both training wise and just the whole ethos people i train with etc im currently doing my final year of my bsc sports and exercise science degree in the uk and deciding what to do afterwards ive had quite a few years worth of training not exclusively crossfit but at an elite sports level as well as quite a bit of experience coaching people im considering a physiotherapy masters after my degree but thats another storyone of the routes im thinking of going down is getting my cf level  coaching cert and start coaching people however i got my level  pt qualification a while ago and worked in a normal commercial gym training clients and while i enjoyed teaching people i feel most of the job was pretty much being a glorified sales person it was literally just walking around the gym floor and cold calling people to try convince them they needed to buy pt sessions and when they did it was very rarely people who wanted to train and improve rather just people who thought magically buying  hours of pt sessions would make them lose all their fat so from my perspective crossfit coaching eliminates some of these issues people actually come there to train and they come for group sessions rather than me having to walk around a gym hunting for prospective clients im just wondering if anyone could share some experiences theyve had or if you could just go over what some of the differences between each experience would be thanks for any help,crossfit

years ago i read a book by a soviet authors that made the argument that sports are inherently unsafe and if adults goal for children is to build up their bodies children should pursue fitness instead of sports the authors argued health not competition should take precedence in the gymnasium the oath of doctors says first do no harm i think parents and maybe more importantly administrators of kids should adopt the same mindset and i think crossfit is in a unique position sorry for the gg phrase to shift the conversation about childrens physical development away from sports and toward fitness because it combines the two in broad flexible ways if we could refine crossfit to a broader stable of safer movements and deemphasize competition with anyone but oneself i think kids could get through childhood  with fewer injuries and  prepared with the skills and mindset to exercise on their own postgraduationheresy ideal but idealistic magnetos perfectionbtw i understand sports have other potential benefits besides exercise like teamwork determination commitment grit fun babysitting sunshine fresh air camaraderie school spirit relationships etc but like my post about jumping rope the same benefits can be found elsewhere but without the cte shoulder dislocations deformed feet torn acls the list goes on,crossfit

one sentence backstory i have a seriously damaged shoulder and if i want any hope of being an athlete for the rest of my life i have to get surgeryi have scheduled my surgery and im about two weeks out and i am absolutely mortified and i know i shouldnt bei have had this injury for a handful of years now but i have worked out with it anyway it tends to not bother me unless i really stress the joint but my shoulder will dislocate when i get sloppy and since the last dislocation i have been pretty seriously debilitated of course this frankly minor surgery is in my best interest and could potentially allow me to perform oly lifts and gymnastics for the rest of my life things i cannot do now because of this injuryhowever ill be onehanded for something like six months and not able to workout at capacity for another six exercise specifically crossfit has become part of my identity in recent years and i dont think ive gone more than a week without training ever since i started i suppose that what goes on inside a gym feels like the one thing i can control in a world thats so crazy and the progress that i have made  meager or not  means a lot to me im scared to sit around for a prolonged amount of time just to watch my work get undonebelieve me i know im being dramatic but this still bothers me any thoughts of encouragement would be more than welcomethose of you who have dealt with injuries did you mitigate losses somehow,crossfit
guys i had to quit after  years of being a committed  days a week crossfit athlete  years ago i ran into financial trouble and had to cut costs where i could i sold my car shopped at the dollar store and quit all “extracurricular” activities i finally have enough money again to afford crossfit however i am very anxious about it a box in my area that i went to for about  months recently opened a second location and did a promo code for the first  members to sign up for the new location would get  months at  for either locations so i jumped on it but i just feel like everyone is going to remember me as what i used to be and right now i am nowhere near that over the pandemic i would go on some runs do some dumbbell work with what i had but that’s it i haven’t lifted a barbell nor seen a rig in over  years i guess i’m just wondering if anyone else has been through something similar and can give some feedback thanks,crossfit

ill start off by saying that i have been doing crossfit for  years im quite mediocre im not a competitive person and ive never been one to push myself extremely hard i see others shave reps so they will not be last to finish a workout but i will gladly finish last in order to complete a workout honestly competition and pushing yourself is a big part of crossfit and at times ive wondered if maybe it wasnt the right fit for me because that isnt something i find myself interested or invested in let me be clear that i do put effort into workouts but i dont push myself to the extremes like many athletes do for years now i have dealt with a fellow gym goer that clearly did not like me i give her space leave her alone i dont try to interact with her i know she talks shit about me and recently shes been making pretty rude comments to me in front of others after the most recent comment a mutual friend finally disclosed why she dislikes me so much its because she thinks i am weak i think this bothers me so much because she has scratched the surface of one of my insecurities i dont push myself like a lot of other crossfitters but clearly it is not enough of an issue that i have changed it it would be silly to change myself just to prove this person wrong i dont know exactly what i am looking for here maybe i am looking for other people who approach crossfit like me maybe im looking to hear from a crossfitter who also gets irritated by people who dont push themselves to the edge maybe im looking to hear that pushing yourself in workouts isnt the only form of mental toughness i would just love to hear some thoughts from others thank you in advance,crossfit

am struggling to understand what an optimum weight for someone my size should be in order to be as effective as possible in crossfit i am   and around  at the moment and have gotten very lean as a result of doing crossfit over the past few months i train often twice a day including my rugby training and my calorie intake definitely isnt what it should be as a result i run the risk of getting more and more lean whilst aesthetically its a nice problem to have it will begin to have an impact on my crossfit performance and weight lifting ability my question then is what weight should i be is there a golden ratio of height to weight for cross fitters i can imagine being too heavy whilst beneficially for big  is detrimental for some of the gymnastics and running for example similarly being too light has its own problems appreciate there are a number of metrics at play that shouldnt be overlooked but i wondered whether anyone had a similar experience it looks like most cross fitters sit around  but given my height that might not be  in advance,crossfit

so recently i decided i wanted to do crossfit after a long time bodybuilding as i was getting bored with the repetitiveness of bodybuilding and also wanted to drop some body fat i posted here once asking for advice transitioning and based on this advice i formulated the below work out regime but have a few questions which i would love answers to currently i’m doing a full one hour crossfit workout including some strength training focusing on compound exercises three times a week and then my regular bodybuilding and strength training on alternating days i also have one rest day where i usually play tennis feel free to give me any tips on the above if i’m doing something wrong my questionsis it weird that i just cannot do doubleunders how can i get there where can i get some good nutrition plans how much of a concern is overtraining with my regimen i’ve been following it for  weeks without fatigue since i’ve been properly warming up and cooling down for the first time the gym bros never seemed to pay attention to that but i love how much emphasis crossfit puts on it,crossfit

i workout with my brother and we randomly come up with workouts he is definitely more focused on putting on muscle and getting stronger than losing a ton of fat or working on his endurancehe always says away from putting in cardio based moves into his words because he thinks being winded will cut into his gains somehow so he wont ever do anything like sprints row assualt bike etc into his workoutshe will instead do mostly just a mix of more strength stuffis there any science to back up the benifit of mixing cardio moves in with the strength moves for wods,crossfit

so about a month ago i posted on here trying to see it was realistic or feasible for me to try crossfit i have been getting increasingly overweight and quarantine certainly did not help my eating habits and activity levels however i was super intimidated because of how overweight i was how intimidating some of the workouts looks and doing a class in a group self conscious  everyone here was absolutely supportive and encouraging and i decided to give it a trythe first week i was incredibly sore to the point that i couldnt walk quite normally almost everything had to be modifiedscaled  however everyone at the box was incredibly friendly and supportive the coaches made sure to take extra time with me to see what my ability is and help me with correct form before doing anything with weights i was really struggling with recovery and a member gave me about a month of protein shake mix to help my recovery i always thought these were a gimmick but oh my gosh it helped so much i have also been focusing on my eating increasing veggie and protein intake and cooking my meals as obviously most weight loss happens at homein only  weeks it has been so fun to see the progress i have made i dont know my current stats i can update in a few weeks when i get another body scan but i have been able to have longer endurance lift more and modify less the first week i struggle to row  in  minutes and last week i did  in  not the best time for sure but an incredible increase in my abilities i no longer get winded going up the stairs at work the craziest thing is i actually am looking forward to getting up to workout at  have never ever been someone excited to exercise ever so this is huge for me i get massages about once a month and my masseuse asked if i was doing something different as she could tell i had built some muscle as wellanyway i am just trying to put my experience out there because i know it can be hugely scary to start crossfit when you are not in shape and i want you all to know that it is completely do able and you will probably love it i am so glad i started this and cannot wait to see how much more i will be capable of and how my quality of life will change if you are needing that extra push to get started or have any questions please feel free to pm me i am not expert but can definitely offer all the encouragement in the world,crossfit

for the past  weeks my strength and punching speed has increased   been trying a lot to find a method that really can improve those things without the need to use extra dumbbell  get me wrong dumbbell weights are dumbbell weights you cant replace  when ive started using this product the differences were seen extremely  cant compare it to anything else  gives you a fullbody workout at the gym hotel room or even in your own  youre probably  the hell is  a resistance belt for boxing mma or just a sports  i said i bought it  weeks ago i am extremely happy with it it was a lifesaver for  training plays a massive role in every sport enhance speed gain explosive power  increase muscle strength amp conditioning burn  basically put it around your body and you can improve strength endurance amp  resisting your muscles as you contract them they force those muscles to work harder and grow stronger  a great way to increase strength using your own body without the need to use extra dumbbell  hope i have been helpful to people who have been in my  you want to know where i bought it from send me a pm i would be very happy to help you  have a nice day guys wish you the best,crossfit

i am a  year old male who has been doing crossfit for a little over two years has been training  days a week and sometimes twice a day and can rx most workouts during that time while i’ve had nagging tendinitis in my knees i never had any major injuries until nowfor the past two weeks i have been dealing with left shoulder pain and yesterday i saw a sports medicine doctor who suspects that i have a rotator cuff tear i had an mri the same day and will get the results soon but i’m preparing myself for the worsti normally struggle with depression and see a therapist regularly and take medication for it but fitness was a huge outlet for managing it i was also in the best shape of my life and i was pushing myself hard at the gym because i had a goal to eventually get to competitors level locally competitive i think i was pushing too hard and it may have been a reason i’m where i’m at now and looking back i am angry at myself and my body for not being able to cope with the training i was doing i’m bummed out and straight depressed that i’m going to lose what i’ve worked so hard to gain plus my girlfriend is also heavily into crossfit and we would frequently do workouts together and now that bond that we have is going to be disruptedfor anyone who has dealt with a major injury how did you cope with not being able to basically do the thing that you love the reality of all this is now starting to sink in and it’s weighing down hard,crossfit

i’m a little over a year from rotator cuff repair surgery full thickness tear of my supraspinatus to be exact i’ve recovered and gotten back to my normal activities though i have to scale on some hanging moves and i’m afraid to try kipping moves anyway every now and again if i try something new or push myself beyond what my shoulder is “used to” which i try not to do i get this intense achy feeling it’s not pain like normal joint pain it’s hard to describe like the foreign parts on my shoulder are readjusting or something i literally start to worry if i broke or stressed the repair  then it fades a bit and within  hours it’s gone and i assume crisis avoided this weekend i was struggling to get back down the rope and kinda fell into basically hanging by my arms and having to gain control old me could hang no problem but new me’s shoulder started the strange uncomfortable ache i have a hard time discerning “i hurt my shoulder” vs my shoulder is going to do this every time i do something new or intense i think i can handle the latter but it’s a little scary given that i’m even more susceptible to shoulder injuryhas anyone experienced this,crossfit
so ive been doing crossfit for a few years not a newbie but not advanced master level there is a laundry list i need to work on how do you deal or process coachess comments for tips sometimes i got very confusing because one coach says one thing the other coach could be completely contradict  its hard to follow for example i was working on cleaning up my butterfly pullups one coach said dont over extragerate hip pop another coach said more hip pop one coach said hands should be closer another one said hands placement is fineim welcomed all the advices i can get from coaches but sometimes it can be a little overwhelming,crossfit

for two weeks i’ve been having issues with my left shoulder and earlier today i saw a sports medicine doctor who informed me that he suspects i have a rotator cuff tear he scheduled me for an mri which i’m going to have later today and when i asked him how to modify my workouts he basically said “if it hurts don’t do it”i have been doing crossfit for two years and i was actually going to have my first competition the festivus games but the affiliate in my host city canceled it because of covid and i was planning on competing within the next six months but i’m not sure if i’ll be able to do that i posted here earlier about having a string of bad workouts bad karen time bad damn diane and i was given great suggestions on how to improve my wall ball and hspu endurance but with that injury those will probably have to be put on holdhow can i best work around my shoulder issues without losing fitness i’m so close to being at rx level for all the movements we do and i’ve been training very hard six days a week and sometimes twice a day because i want to get to a high level locally i’m really hoping this won’t set me back too much,crossfit
so this is mostly just a shameless bragg because im just to giddy this happend and i feel like telling everyone were redoing the crossfit games last week and on the  row i got  the fastest time in my box so far some other members were pushing me saying i should try and beat the top score that day so far at  because im  tall and have such an advantage on rowing i was laughing and saying sure but my previous score was  so didnt actually believe i was going to get under  i knew his split time was just above  for most of the first  meters so i when i noticed i was still rowing  split most of the time at  meters my hart jumped and i realized i could actually do this  i ended up finishing in  completely destroyedi would probably have never finished that fast if i didnt have a goal some of the though guys were downplaying it because of my length but i dont care im just to happy im not one of the fittest in the box by a long shot so getting first place probably wont happen again soon this really made my week,crossfit
hello i’m thinking about transitioning from powerliftingbodybuilding style workouts to something closer to crossfit i’ve done a little bit of research online but i wanted to get some opinions and ideas from multiple different people currently i workout about  days with workouts centered around squat bench deadlift  days with accessory movements after the heavy compound stuff i was wondering if anyone else has done a transition similar to this and if so what did you do what worked and what didn’t,crossfit
hi i am a newbie crossfitter  and looking for your opinion in case of a couple of questions about crossfit progression and injuries   first of all i feel like my progression is not as good as it should be i was always a skinny guy i am  cms and was  when i started crossfit and now i am  kgs i definitely gained some definition i mean i changed my bodys composition from skinny to slightly athletic since i started november   my  are  squat  deadlift and  overhead press but i feel that my cardio performance is improving very slowly why should i eat more i know a lots of people who eat one hamburgerday and gain a crazy amount of weightfat unfortunately i gain nothing i eat approximately  calsday and i know its not enough butits sooo hard to learn to cookingsecond point is injury before i started cf i was in the beginning of a recovery process from a severe addiction it means i didnt do any kind of sports in the past  years before nov  my mobility is shit but a lots of people have poor mobility and dont be injured but i injured my back from deadlift in the beginning it was a deep fascia problem according to my physio when we solved that i injured my left knee by poor squatting technique probably jumpers knee from patella tendon overuse we are in the middle of the process to solve that but in the last two weeks i feel that something is not ok with my elbows from the viewpoint of symptomology i feel i developed golfers elbow tennis elbow and triceps tendonitis alsoso its crazy why am i injured so easily i try my best about good technique my coach is a highly educated crossfitter and competitor he is the training coach of our citys volleyball and handball team so i dont understand what is happening i dont want to stop crossfit i love it but i feel something needs to be changed if i want to do it for my health and happiness what do you think your two cents would be helpful to me thanks,crossfit

because of an injury ive explored a variety of cf alternative classes the cycles  orange theorys and general bootcampish gymsthe workouts were generally solid and definitely build an engine but i found that the sense of community just wasnt at the same level as a cf box it was there but didnt seem to be as tight as a cf boxthe difference is in the typical  part approach with cf after the warmup you move to strengthskill at this point you setup and have an opportunity to chat about what weight youre gonna try or whateverafter that parts done you cleanup amp setup for the wod another chance to talk about the new pr you just hit or how much you hate burpees in the upcoming wod etc these are two recurring bondforming opportunities that arent as prevalent in other instructorled fitness classes which are more gogogo from start to finishi think cf has hit the real sweetspot for community building with just the right amount of social touchpoints within each classhave you guys had similar experiences with other instructor led formats,crossfit

i currently have a nutrition coach and i’m just looking for some other opinions on if i should be looking another coach or staying the course this is my first time working with someone and maybe this is all normal but i’m just unsure just some general detailsi’m a  male i’m on week  i went from weighing in at  to consistently weighing in at  my macros are currently  with a refeed day of  over the course of the  weeks i feel like i am less bloated and have lost some water weight but i don’t feel like i have seen any real changes in body composition the frustrating part and the main reason for my post is that my coach seems to keep my at my macros without adjustment for  weeks at a time of no progress i feel like after  weeks of no progress my macros would change my question really being if this is normal or anyone has some opinions on this i feel like staying at macros that aren’t providing any progress is wasting time in the long run,crossfit

 m started crossfit a year ago and it’s been one of the best decisions i’ve ever made only wish i had started sooner i love the community aspect and working out with a group who pushes each other to do their best everyone at the gym has been really friendly and welcoming from day one although i think lately my own insecurities and mental blocks get in the way socially and with my progress i tend to still get encouragement and a push from the coaches during wods and some days i’m able to get through the wod and feel good about what i’ve done other days my head gets in the way and everything goes out the window my own worst enemy is myself and i hold myself backso sometimes and maybe it’s just me self projecting but i feel like some of the other members notice or feel that i need the push and find it annoying or disruptive or that i haven’t grown out of a beginner phase i’m not sure or maybe it’s just that i tend to be a bit quiet but i’ve always been friendly and i respect everyone at the gym and all the coaches a ton on the other hand this may all just be me beating myself up for being a year in and still having some wods not go smoothly for me by not being able to go unbroken or without taking some sort of rest for example it comes off even more odd because physically i look very fit but i feel like i look stronger than i am i suppose i am more so venting but wasn’t sure if some crossfitterscoaches have any tips on pushing through the mental challenges in crossfitthanks,crossfit

today one of the most sought after effects in the fitness and health sector is fat loss we are going to provide you with a protocol consisting of training supplementation and diet focused on fat loss and that its validity has been proven this protocol is very effective and should be used to finish a cutting phase after hitting a plateau or if you have a high fat percentage and want to start losing fat effectively this protocol is nothing new at least the parts that compose it but it works very well together and i think that some of you would find it very  are going to focus on a metabolic type training for two reasons it is an intense training that consumes a lot of kcal and increases our metabolic rate in the short term i would do this type of training  to  times a week and the rest of our training days follow your normal workout routinea metabolic training is usually composed of compound exercises with very little rest between them the training will consist of supersets groups of different exercises of which we will perform  sets of  reps resting between  to  secs  barbell squats standing dumbbell shoulder press  standard lunges incline dumbbell bench press  single arm dumbbell rows v upsi would also recommend doing  minutes of cardio at a steady pace after finishing your  are going to do a psmf diet it is a diet really high in protein and low in caloriesif we have less than  fat m or  w we will consume  x kg of lbm on metabolic training days and  on weight training days and  per kg of lbm on resting days we will follow the diet for  days and we will carry out a carbohydrate load  days in a row after finishing itif you have a higher fat percentage  m or  w the protein will be  per kg of lbm on metabolic training days and  per kg of lbm on weight training days on resting days  per kg of lbm the athletes in this category can have a cheat meal each week and do a carb load once a week for  weeksmales with bf higher tham  or woman with bf higher than  should consume  per kg of lbm on metabolic training days  gr on weight training days and  on resting days athletes should follow this diet for  weeks and have two cheat meals per weekcarbs and fats will only be consumed in trace  stimulates the ns increases energy expenditure and the transport of fats and their oxidationegcg increases energy expenditure and lipid oxidationpsynephrine increases metabolism lipolysis and thermogenesisi would recommend taking them at a dosage of  caffeine or more   synephrine   egcg  minutes before training,crossfit

most functional training was brought to light in  with the release of the movie  mark twight  the then cofounderowner was the “goto” guy for changing aesthetics in hollywood and proceeded to train actors in movies to follow somewhere along the lines there was a massive falling out with then gym operator  bobby maximus  and mark left or was forced out bobby then went on to  start his own self brand where he posts pictures of himself flexinga lotunfortunately  mark through his new endeavors has released the training program with accompanying essay on the origins of this it is highly worth the time to go read as he has put it out for free aside from russel berger’s boisterous attempt to infiltrate gym jones and brag about himself in a cf journal article does anyone else know what happened to force mark out i’ve tried searching and the knowledge is limited from what i could find,crossfit

i have never kept up to date with the inner happenings of crossfit but im trying to understand something i know toomeyfraser et al moved to cookeville i thought this was to train with droning is this true  i was reading shane orr is now frasers coach but then on every episode of buttery bros chief is with toomey and fraser who is frasers coachwhat does chief do for these two athletes why is he always with themwhy did they move to cookeville,crossfit
it seems like medeiros was faster than fraser in the movements but medeiros video only shows  rounds it does show the first and the last round but because the runs are cut out there is no way of telling if he actually did  rounds or not the results on the leaderboard are  for fraser and  for medeiros so what happened did they just forget to edit one round into the video if so the missing round must have been really slow or did he only do  rounds and they added some time as a penalty,crossfit
so i bought the nano x had the ’s for almost  years and had it in size  just a bit too big my normal shoe size is  so i figured that i would scale it a bit downnow i don’t know how a shoe should fit size  nano x feels snug nothing hurts but it’s snug at the toes as well size  nano  was a bit big had over a thumb space between my big toe and the front size  has  of a thumb from the big toe to the front should i keep the  or should i buy a  don’t know if the shoe does break in and gives a little more room in the front cheers,crossfit

there are many great resources for online programming and wod generators but i haven’t found any that include warmups to work up to the wod it is so important to properly warm up your body before doing certain movements and the warmups that i’ve been throwing together are pretty bad suggestions please background my so and i have been doing crossfit regularly for  years we understand all the vocabulary and most of the movements skill wise we are pretty average can rx some things scale a lot more things we are midthirties with small children so a simple allinclusive goto programming option would be ideal we have a garage gym that has barbells wall balls kettlebells rower and a rig,crossfit
ive recently started crossfit and due to work schedules can only make a wod between  what i struggle with is timing food so as not to get fatigued during the session today in the morning i had a largeish breakfast and lunch by  and could still feel it digesting a bit at  when the workout started i think it contributed to a pretty bad performance today  i tired very easily and couldnt do the burpees as my body was just giving up due to fatiguehas anyone else experienced this how do you optimize your eating times if youre doing later afternoon workouts,crossfit

sorry up front for this lengthy question i’m new to crossfit not in very good shape and  yrs old i used to be reasonably athletic and probably to the average person with me wearing a baggy shirt they likely would overestimate my current athletic ability i joined my local box a couple months back admittedly after seeing the redeemed and the dominant i have been really inspired by the crossfit community and enjoy the style of workouts my issue is this i feel like i’m really not getting much in the way of coaching or even suggested scaling from my box and it’s becoming a bit discouraging i have no plans on quitting crossfit but i’m trying to figure out if i’d be better off just investing the money i’m currently putting into monthly dues towards home equipment and then once i build up my fitness rejoining a box at this point i feel like i’m not learning much about the fundamentals of olympic lifting and i’m struggling to even finish each workout for whatever reason i feel like my coaches are just assuming i know how to snatch clean etc even though i most definitely don’t should i just keep sticking it out at what feels like a subpar box or try and go the home route is it even realistic to think i’ll be able to “selfteach” myself the fundamentals,crossfit

i don’t know if forcefully depriving yourself of oxygen while doing a high intensity wod is necessarily worth it or even beneficial for performance in any sort of matter are you getting the same benefits had you trained without a mask say you could normally do a wod in  minutes but with a mask it takes you  minutes would the same physiological adaptations result i’ve kind of just been focusing on strength work since my gym requires a mask and doing cardio without a mask on my own,crossfit

i said it last year when everyone was like mats slipping i was like nah it was only that penalty combined with something not entirely in his wheelhouse that created that point deficit he would have had another games win where he probably would have already had it in the bag on the last event if not for those circumstances even castro said not too long ago that mat is all hollywood now with appearances and not focused nope look at the gap hes already created after  events lol that dude is consistent and knows how to put his feet up in the pain cave better than anyone i believe ive seen him win events that werent his strength merely cause he has that stubbornness to push through the burn when smart people rest when they feel its absolutely necessary ill eat my words if he doesnt win this year with an extremely comfortable gap and i should say im not really a big fraser fan im just stating what seems super evident im a big josh bridges fan for the record id love to see him as a contender again but i think his time has passed sadly,crossfit

this sounds silly but i’m new to this so far my box hasn’t been super strict about signing up for classes but we do have to wear a mask unless it’s a heavy cardio sorta day anyways i have a late meeting annoying it could’ve been an email and my work is about half hour away from my box and i think i’ll be between  minutes late is it worth trying to make that class at that late again might be silly but i had a group trainer last year that would make people do burpees for being late even if you notified her i feel like crossfit is welcoming and understands life happens sometimes,crossfit
i feel like crossfit is missing an opportunity to broadcast the games this year  i feel that they could have broadcast the events similarly to rogue  obviously it wouldnt be in real time but they could have just synced the videos to the start time and had announcers call the action  a pretend live event  it would have brought some of the drama thats missing from the results show,crossfit
hey all been crossfitting for a little more than two years  yearold male ’” and around  lbs and i usually go  days a week we just tested karen today and i did terrible at  rx my shoulders were just beyond fried at the end and needless to say i finished lasti’m quite disappointed with that performance i was aiming for around  minutes but after  wall balls i knew that wasn’t happening i figured that after doing this for more than two years i should have gotten a much better time especially when comparing my times to others who have been crossfitting a similar amount of time what can i do to get better i also make sure that since wall balls are my weakness i frequently do wods with them at open gym so i am tryingi do admit there are factors that i think influenced my poor time today is my day off from work so i did an early morning class whereas i usually do afternoons i’m nursing a torn callus and i feel a bit banged up from the past two wods we did but i think even considering that i should have done better,crossfit

i’ve been working out with various intensities for about three years now after losing a whole lot of weight and focusing on my fitness i really got into running but haven’t been able to get my runs in recently i also do weight lifting  bodybuilding with a focus on strength training and muscle size around  times a week but recently i’ve been feeling bored by the repetitive nature of strength training and have noticed that i’ve been putting on a bit of fat along with the muscle and have been wanting to experiment with crossfit my body fat percentage is  not good i know but i was at about  only three years ago and i seriously want it to drop below  i have a fairly good home gym and don’t want to sign up to classes and have been studying up on crossfit hoping to add some of the elements of crossfit to my workout routine or at least to do straight up crossfit a few days a week in addition to my normal routine i’ve always enjoyed hiit workouts my thinking is that i can build my workouts as suchwarmup  minscrossfit wod  minsstrength training  minscool down  minsis this a good idea and if so what would you recommend i take into account how should i do my muscle splits i currently do an arm day chest amp back legs and shoulders on separate days but i understand crossfit does not have a split should i just add any wod at the beginning and just continue with my own usual split,crossfit

we’re having a friendly guygirl competition at my gym this week’s  cal  squat clean  abmat situpsbroken up however you like one partner must be on the bike at all times  min time capwhat should our strategy be here switch after a certain number cals do sets of so many reps ie  clean  situps switch we have no idea where to go with this i can’t even guess if we’ll have the bike done before the other two movements lol,crossfit
so the box was shut down for about three months due to covid  i was not able to do any of the zoom classes because i dont have the space or equipment to do anything besides body weight stuffim fortunate in that i could afford to keep paying for my membership because i wanted to have a box to go back tomy membership is up for renewal and they want to increase the price on me  its not a huge increase its just the principle of the thing  i feel like anyone who paid nearly  per month while getting nothing in return should at least be grandfathered under their previous rate  i get that they are running a business but i feel like the owners are being kind of ungrateful  thoughts,crossfit

good day all  i stopped going to my box in january due to some ownership changes and my schedule with work and family making it difficult to make a session during the morning or evening i set out to start working out at home and building my own mini gym with getting some programming via linchpin or other  sadly once i figured this out we hit  and all gym equipment disappeared from the market ive been waiting and waiting and waiting on rogue to get equipment back in stock but ive missed the few times they had x item in stock  i really want to get a concept  rower and dont want to settle for less  my ankles are trash so rowing is my main cardio route  so all that said id love some direction to other vendors of bars plates dumb bells i should be looking at  also need to get a rack to assist with squats i dont need it to have a pull up bar but thatd be a bonus  thanks in advance for helping me get off my covid ,crossfit
hi i am relatively new to crossfit as ive been doing for  months now i am an  year old male thats wondering what some good benchmarks are such as fran time campj and snatch what do you think are some good goals to set as a new crossfitter,crossfit
so my first class starts in half an hour and im sat in the car park terrified worried about how i look my fitness level and looking stupid looking through this reddit its very clear this is a common emotion and i see nothing but support so using all of your stories to help me not turn my car on and drive right off home wish me luck,crossfit
im a fairly average crossfitter male  for example i have a  back squat an  cj can do one strict handstand press up but cant do pistols or muscle ups just for context and am wondering how i can take my training to the next level by that im not talking the games or anything near that just so that i can become one of the best in my box and just post some impressive rx times any advice would be much appreciated,crossfit
just curious  my squat clean has never been very high and i would like to work on it  i say not high i mean relative to my other strengths  im  male and  lbs  i can clean  all day long  sometimes i can do  and on a really good day with a good lift ive hit   i can front squat  all day long for reps  so i feel like if i can get under the bar faster i should be able to clean allot more  my question is how relevant is your deadlift  front squat strength to your clean  i ask this because when i try to pull more than  off of the ground for that first pull it seems impossible to get it moving fast enough or high enough for me to get under the bar  i see others my size and weight or smaller successfully lifting  lbs like its nothing  are these guys able to deadlift near  lbs to be able to get  lbs moving that fastfor reference my front squat is  back squat  and deadlift   do those numbers have anything to do with it  theoretically i should be able to clean  right  if i could only figure out how to get the bar and my body moving fast enoughwhat im really trying to do is figure out where my deficit is and where i need to focus my efforts  clearly technique is an issue but is overall strength an issue as wellhope this all makes sense,crossfit

after watching my place on the  waiting list slowly move closer to a reality rower and skierg i’m starting to worry that it’s not as feasible as i once hopedthe context is that i have moved from a small flat to a small house and therefore been excited about all of the additional space myself and my partner now have a spare room and garden one of which i was hoping i would be able to store some of my gym equipment now that we have moved i’ve realised that while the space is nice it still isn’t likely big enough for large machines although will have space for barbell etcthe current options i see myself with  only buy one machine likely rower and hope that my partner doesn’t mind too much about having an ‘eyesore’ visible in the house at all  come up with some creative way to take down and store the equipment after each workout hopefully limiting the time taken to do this as to not put me off big cardio  store the machines in the garden  my only worry here is them getting damaged quickly any tips or tricks appreciatedif anybody has been in a similar situation or has any ideas on how to solve this problem it would be hugelyappreciatedthanks all,crossfit
i’m  and i’ve been doing crossfit for almost  years now i do class  days a week and then supplement with runs or hikes daily super high energy dog lol before finding crossfit i grew up always playing sports and then did  years of competitive rowing through college i’m pretty average at crossfit rowing and running are my strengths and i’m solid at the body weight movements gymnastics stuff is fun and i’m working on getting my strict pullups post covid closure eventually i wanna get muscle ups and handstand pushups my lifts are all over the place and pretty mediocre i can power clean more than i can squat this is where i really want to improve but i’m not sure howi crushed  discs in my lower back almost  years ago i have had two back surgeries to repair it but last year i jumped off a wall and landed wrong and fractured a vertebra and herniated a disc it hurts daily but nothing that’ll stop me from working out the dr said it’s stable and i can lift within reason has anyone used a lifting belt with a back injury  does it help or does it mask the injury my big fear would be that i wouldn’t realize i was lifting more than i was capable of,crossfit

i like to exercise  the exercises i like are those that make me feel exhausted after practicing them but i should say at the same time i lack the discipline necessary to see concrete resultswith me trying to conceive the gynecologist suggested crossfit to me because it is strength training that in her opinion could help during labor if possible once pregnant you could substitute risky exercises with the help of the coach and such she is a crossfitter herself and she trained until  monthso i tried to start crossfit one month ago the box features are great a lot of attention from the coaches very patient they are but by the second week i started to feel super disheartened by the terminology and the speed amrap bpcleancp hspu metcon powerclean all those things the names of the exercises overwhelmed me not counting the fact that my poor chickenwing arms could barely lift  of dumbbells the last time i went the wod it consisted of working intervals in pairs  that day i was randomly matched with a workout partner who looks like thor had a baby with capitain america and the only thing i felt is that i was so bad at it a week has passed without going to the box  i have a wod scheduled for  today and yet i dont think ill godont get me wrong i loved crossfit but i think that the lack of discipline i have and the feeling of pressure i feel during class have demotivated me enough to question whether i want to continue ,crossfit

so i’ve made a separate post for this since i realized i had some problems with my gym the owner isn’t there personally since he had to move away but our main coach has gotten lazy my coach doesn’t correct form on olympic lifts at all it drives me nuts why am i the one asking the coach— “are my hips rising too fast are my elbows out etc” i haven’t gotten any better at the snatch in  years i watch the juggernaut training yt vids and try to go to open gym and practice i was trying to do the hip contact drill for the snatch and my coach just laughed at me it was frustrating honestly you’re not teaching me so if i’m trying to teach myself then maybe you should not laugh at me is this typical for cf gyms will i ever get better at olympic lifts just by teaching myself,crossfit

i’ve  been doing crossfit for a little over  years it’s been great so far coaches are cool fellow athletes are cool some workouts are better than others despite my  years of experience i’m still working on a lot of things especially conditioning and endurance during the longer metcons i consistently have been the last if not the one of the last person to finish during metcons i’ve hit many time caps and have dnf’d my fair share of them i try to focus on the fact that at the end of the day i’ve got a good workout in and i was productive however there are times where it bothers me that i’m almost always the last to finish when people around me make it look so easy now during all of this it ends up being me still huffing and puffing my way through a workout while everyone else in the class starts cheering me on and praising me “c’mon man you can do it” “keep going bro” “nice man don’t drop that bar” “what number are you on man only a few reps left” “give me at least  more man you got it”  of course i’m very much sure all of these people are being nice and are actually trying to be supportive but deep down it irks me for some reason before crossfit i’ve always worked out alone never really felt the need of having a companion during my workouts just went to the gym did my thing and left i had my own reasons to keep motivated i’m not afraid to admit that perhaps it’s my own insecurity when i’m the last one still working out and all of those people start cheering it makes me feellike i’m bad at working out it’s like cheap patronizing i almost feel like it’s forced and these people are being fake again i’m sure that’s not the case but while i’m damn near dying with  burpees to go i’d rather get myself into the zone and block everything out sorry i think i’ve rambled enough i wrap up by saying i like all the people at my gymbox i just get bothered by being cheered on and i don’t have the heart to ask them to stop because i’ll feel like an asshole for sure,crossfit

anyone on here use the whoop strap i’ve had it for a month and it seems to really undervalue crossfit workouts like massively i can do a pretty hard wod that lasts  minutes and i get a strain score under  then i can do a moderate  min jog and get a strain score of  i done understand it i got the strap because i saw quite a few athletes have it and they like it i’m wondering if it’s just me or if everyone has this issue i’d put this on the whoop sub but all you get is downvotes and shitty comments if you post anything but absolute praise for the damn thing  thanks,crossfit
i live an apartment at the momenti have a bikeerg so far and while i like it i was thinking of getting a  rower to complement itthe bikeerg is tolerable for levels but i heard the rower is louder and because it is more perpetual vs constant it might be more annoying,crossfit

i go to a small crossfit gym thats owned by a husband and wife unfortunately due to some family circumstances they have decided to close the gym and this will be our last week its a very bittersweet feeling for mei started crossfit at this gym about  years ago i was overweight and did not exercise i think i had early signs of sleep apnea slightly high blood pressure and was probably prediabetic i think i about died on my assessment workout but liked the workouts and the environment and kept coming back along with diet i eventually lost  pounds and would say that im likely in the best shape of my lifelike i said our gym is small we only have between  and  people per class and at this point only really have two classes per day the owners are effectively the only coaches its not the nicest or cleanest gym in town but it has felt like a family and im definitely going to miss it and the people therethe owners are going to be selling the equipment to us and after having good success working out at home during the covid lockdown ive decided to purchase some and go allin on the home gym thing im looking forward to doing my own programming and being able to do different types of workouts and focus on the things that i want and knowing that i wont have to make myself do wallballs or thrusters i will likely focus on the crossfit methodology with some other stuff thrown in im actually excited about it but sad for the reason its happening i guess there isnt really a point to this post other than saying how much crossfit and this gym changed my life thanks for reading,crossfit

hello i’ve been doing crossfit for a few months now i’m finally getting used to the olympic lifts however i really struggle with which bar to use at times for example here is the workout tomorrow“ questionsfor  power   push  hang power  overhead  front squatsrx  on the minute  burpeesi am assuming we will choose a weight to stick with throughout the exercise my limiting factor will be the amount of weight i can overhead squat which right now is  so here is my question i can either use the training bar with  plates which equals  or i can use the women’s bar which is a total of  alone i am a girl and i feel like the women’s bar is more comfortable in your opinion is it more beneficial to use the bar alone which is more comfortable in my hands or is it better to use the training bar so i can have actual plates on it they both equal the same but i’m not sure if having plates makes a difference or not i will also ask the coach tomorrow but i wanted to see if anyone else has encountered this before thank you,crossfit

i go to the only crossfit gym in a town of  there is a woman in our gym who has had multiple affairs and has a terrible reputation around town  which she has definitely earned because she comes to our gym we now have a reputation that we are just a swingers club basically and everyone just shows up to sleep around on their souses this is despite the fact that we have multiple pastors who work out with us and nobody else in the gym has ever done anything like that does anyone have any suggestions on what to do to push past that stigma we a constantly hear people say they won’t join because they don’t want to be associated with that i personally think it’s just an excuse for people to not come because it’s hard and they don’t want to and it gives them an easy way out i just don’t know what to do to prove that that’s not the way we are at all,crossfit
so our box celebrated  years anniversary last weekend and we did the hero wod murph all together to celebrate iti am sure everyone knows what it is but for those who dont it   pull    runwith a  pound vest on i have been crossfitting for  months now and i never thought in my wildest dreams i could ever do anything like thisit was a scaled version where instead of pullup cant do them yet and we were not allowed boxed this time around i had to do american swings with a  kettlebell and no vest of course the rest stayed the same and i did it in  i just say as hard as it is the whole emotional and mental toll that this brings is something i have never experienced in my life i think it says more about me than the workout looking back this would have been impossible for me at the start of my three month journey the pain and the fatigue and all the mental blocks that one has to power through to finish this is immense and respect to anyone who did this workout recently or ever next year the aim is to do it with proper pull ups and hopefully beat this time i just wanted to share that here and i am so proud of myself that i could finish it in the first place ah and the moment i finished all my breakfast came out and i am glad there was a bin nearby but i will take the finish anyway lets hope next time i can keep all that in peace and love,crossfit

in for a treat and about to upgrade my home gym with an echo bike since space is very limited at this point i am looking into storage options  get the bike in an upright position and lean it against a wall when not in use  is this even  store it outside of the garage  would solve the space issue for surr although i am slightly concerned regarding wear of some parts even if i’d cover it up i would question the longevity of say the monitor and other parts  plus we tend to get some heavy winds here and there and i’m afraid of the bike tipping over somehow does anyone have an opinion on that or other smart ideas 😬,crossfit
when  we have box jumps in a work out ill usually do step ups instead  two reasons knees hurt sometimes and my coordination goes to h when im fatigued but i dont think step ups are equivalent to box jumps  step ups seem more like lunges or squats  its not a fast explosive movement  wouldnt doing kettle bell swings be more equivalentill do the jumps until i trip  time then i switch  no need to make the gym call the emts because im too dumb to know when to stop  but id really like to improve my capablity in this area so im trying to figure out what to use as a substitution for the box jumps  ideasrecommendations,crossfit

i started crossfit three months ago and have been regularly going in four times a week i just stumbled into it after coming out of a very toxic relationship i was not exactly in the best of shapes and had no stamina at all i remember in my first week i couldnt do a single push up or even hang from the bar let alone pull myself up and dont even get me started on the assault bike like which sadist made that but i was hurting and i tried to numb some of that pain with a different kind of pain i must add i am in a much better place now with a far healthier outlook on life and am overall very happy oh i can so do real pushup now i never lifted weights before either so it was all new for me and as the time went by i improved i knew it would help me physically but i had no idea how much this would help me improve my mental health i want to thank the community and how easily they accepted me with open arms i didnt expect that and i dont know why but it was very heart warming i want to show gratitude to everyone who i ran into and cheered me on and pushed me and helped me better myself i know it might sound strange but i am a very different person before starting this journey there is just one thing i am struggling with very badly and that is a chin up i still cant do a single one have been working on negative chin ups and getting the volume in with ring rows but i am really losing my patience especially because i have improved everything else so much and so fastif i can get any advice on how to get to my first pull up i would very much appreciate itpeace and love to everyone,crossfit

i do crossfit  days a week  hour a day from  to  pm this entails on average  minutes of strength work followed by  minutes of metcon one caveat is that since the beggining of june weve been doing much less strength work due to weight limitations as a result of the pandemic before the pandemic my lift numbers were all steadily rising but my muscles had only been growing slightly and i hadnt been losing fat back then i was eating around  calories which probably explains the lack of fat lossim a  male   lb around  body fati sleep  hours a night from around  am to  pm which im working on shifting earlier graduallymy tdee is  calories and my diet averages daily to  calories  protein  fat and  carbs more specifically on my  workout days during the week i eat  calories  protein  fat and  carbs and on my  weekend days i eat  calories  protein  fat and  carbs  not perfect but not often and look at the average abovei split my calories and macros evenly among a protein shake and  meals the first of which i eat usually within an hour of waking up and finish eating around  hours before i start working out otherwise i feel it in my stomach i then drink the protein shake within an hour after working out then lunch around  hours after that then dinner  hours after that i finish dinner about an hour before getting in bed and then it takes me a while to fall asleep but i sleep very wellmy goals are to be probably around the same weight i am now but around  body fat which will mean putting on more muscle ive done probably  hours of research on all things fitnessnutrition and am doing everything i can to reach my goals or so i thought given the researchtldr im  male   lb  body fat looking to build muscle and burn fat to reach  bodyfat at my same weight i sleep  hours slightly later than normal eat  calories  protein  fat and  carbs and do crossfit  days a week  minutes strength followed by  minutes metcon am i doing something wrongps i know ill get comments saying this forum is for crossfit not bodybuilding to which i reply i get it but crossfit is my lifestyle i love it to death and think of me as a crossfitter who wants to look as good as i perform not a bodybuilder posting in the wrong forumthank you very much in advance,crossfit

i’ve been doing crossfit at a local box for about a year and a half now and am beginning to wonder if how i feel after a wod is normal i seem to always feel beyond exhausted lying on the floor taking a few minutes to catch my breath and my entire body feeling like it’s had the life drained from it once i do catch my breath and get up i feel like falling asleep usually for the next hour or  my face is flush and my muscles feel shaky on the surface i feel like most people say “that just means you pushed yourself hard” but when i compare myself to others at my gym they appear recovered long before me and even have a better score than me i feel like i’m the only one suffering despite having the slowest timelowest score it’s even more frustrating when newcomers begin outperforming me after a few months of training i’m  years old ’ and about  and like to think i have a thinathletic build i’m by no means a nutrition master but like to think i eat cleanerbetter than your average person balanced meals with snacks in between like fruit nuts protein bars etc i’ve had blood drawn for physical exams within the last couple of years and everything came back normal does anyone else feel the same way after training whether it be crossfit or something equally as intense any advice on what i can do so i can make it through a workout and not be completely drained for the next few hours,crossfit
my olympic lifts are lagging a bit behind my squaddeadlift strength and id like to spend some time focusing on them ive looked at a few free programs burgener various catalyst options and they all look pretty time consuming and relatively highvolume should i just take a few weeksmonths and focus almost exclusively on weightlifting or are there lowervolume options that would leave me time and energy for some wods on the side i wouldnt mind getting my squat up in the process either,crossfit

been attending crossfit classes for around  years and go to  classes a week i’m also on month  of gains lab year of the engine and as a result have been seeing great progress in my capacity during metcons and plan to continue into the polarization phase i recently started the wendler boring but big  program and have been following the ’s as prescribed i’m a male ’  lb and my  rm going into the program are as followsdl         main goals are to increase my dl and bench through the program when working through the  i can knock out  reps on the last set of dl at  lb  i feel like this is a high rep count for the last set maybe i’m wrong and was wondering if anyone has experienced this when going into  from a crossfit background anything i might want to adjust or just continue with the program,crossfit
some backgroundive  jumped down the crossfit rabbit hole over the last year and am absolutely hooked i love watching the games athletes for motivation to keep pushing myself but and as a recognized personal bias a professional marketer by day and a bit skeptical of most things i try not to take everything at face value for truth now i do not have a goal to compete at the games but being able to rx most workouts and do things ive never done before gymnastics moves in particular is definitely on my goals list and i have a competitive spiritbeing able to compete in beginners events or nonelite local box events and not finish dead last would definitely be on my shortlist of goals i was a pretty dedicated athlete in high school but burned out and turned down all of my scholarship offers wouldnt call myself much of an athlete since fwiw but cf has definitely sparked that physical expression and competitiveness in me that i have been restricting for the last  years here comes a second blind spot of mine that i am going to openly admiti am relatively naive and grew up in a family who told me i could bedo anything i want to be age and experience has taught me otherwise but is it healthy to look to games athletes as a guiding motivational compass towards my goals or am i just a victim of influencer marketing can i possibly reach any sort of rxnotable prs without peds three coaches and a nutritional plan around  calories a day to support a required  workouts a day that i would have to do to even come close to rxing anything are elite athletes commonly cycling peds across the board i realize i probably wont get an answer here which is fair and i need to just accept that or is a vast majority natural are we just starting to see the target on cfs back because of jealousy and the tendency for the world to try to belittle any and everythingone that they can behind a monitor and keyboard by saying that what elite athletes of cf accomplish is unnaturalimpossiblerigged in some wayi dont want to call any particular games athlete out but there are quite a few that inspire me on a regular basis some of which are regular posters on this sub maybe i am just naively looking to grasp at straws and find some sort of semblance of good in this world and refuse to accept that most games athletes and this sport is turning into a roided out community that it is impossible for mere mortals such as myself can be a part of or maybe my blind naivety and relentless optimism is shadowing the truthtldr someone shoot me straight here am i falling victim to the rosecolored glasses that is marketing and social media or is rxing movements for laypersons actually still possible with good nutrition and consistency without peds a paytoplay strategy or a dedicated team of coaches programming for you  workouts a day,crossfit

hello everyone curious if anyone experiences severe abdominal swelling during and after crossfit sessions and during any physical exertion many years ago while cycling by myself i felt something heavy in the area between my sternum and navel i was not doing anything strenuous like intervals or race pace training the heaviness made physical efforts a bit harder and i could not belly breath as deeply because something felt in the way in that area during this time my body weight increased by  pounds within a month with no changes to diet sleep or exercise over the years the swelling would get more pronounced especially after every bowel movement and any amount of exercise even  minutes body weight continued to gradually increase have more overall puffiness rather than being lean like beforeit has reached the point that i had to stop crossfit sessions and other aerobic exercise because my abdomen would get swollen like a lady four to six months pregnant ive had many labs and tests and everything came back normal i ruled out it being food related because i experience the pregnant swelling no matter what foods i  eat i also experience the swelling even drinking water i also dont eliminate as much water considering the amount i drink throughout the day it feels like my body is retaining everything i drink rather than eliminating it like it did before the onset of these symptomsit has been a mystery that many doctors ive seen over the years medical and naturopathic cannot find a root cause for the extreme swelling after exercise and bowel movements would appreciate any insight people on this forum may provide because no doctors to date have been successful in helping thank you,crossfit
been doing cf for over a year and a half now and im finally on the verge of a break through with some movements ive been able to do double unders for a few weeks now but the ones im so damn close with but still just not there are  and kipping pull  especially i can swing my toes up and hit the bar relatively easy but i think there is something wrong with my kip i end up swinging too much my coach has told me i need to work on snapping quicker into the next rep its like i end up resetting entirely in between each rep which takes more out of me i dont know how to snap right back into the next rep after doing one  again its like im swinging too much or something i am extremely uncoordinated lol so when i started cf i knew id be a disaster with any thing gymnastics related but it still sucks knowing i have the strength to do something but there is something in my form just barely holding me backim not quite as worried about kipping pull ups right now because tbh id almost rather do strict anyways because i feel like that will make me stronger in the long run maybe if i keep improving id like to have kipping pull ups in my arsenal for the open or something but its a similar problem its like i stop my momentum after doing one repim not sure if any of this makes sense id love advice or maybe this is just ventingranting as well lmao,crossfit
so i have a torn labrum in my shoulder any movements overhead with weight will cause my shoulder do dislocate i did crossfit when i was right out of high school and i was in phenomenal shape i love the idea of being more of an athlete instead of just bulking up in the gym and being big slow and not agile which is what i’ve been the past few years from what i remember we did a lot of thrusters snatch overhead squat etc there’s no way i’d be able to do those exercises is it possible to still participate in crossfit without doing those squats standard and front squat deadlifts pull ups and everything else i could do no problem thanks for reading,crossfit

during a recent workout my coach really wanted me to get my butt down more when doing sumo deadlifts but my hips wouldn’t let me i get pain on the outside of my legs towards my waist when abducting that basically feels like my hips just “don’t bend that way” as opposed to an uncomfortable muscle stretch everything on the internet seems to say that pain due to bone impingement would be in the groin but that’s not at all my symptom i have no pain anywhere but on the outside of my leg and only when abducting “too far” i used to lift heavy and probably with poor form when i was younger and dumber so i wouldn’t be surprised if i messed something up then anyway for the rest of the workout the coach had me sumo to plates instead of the floor so i could use the proper form that worked but i want to know what’s going on can anyone tell me what this is,crossfit

what are your average strain scores for a wodmine ranges from  to  on average with wods with any sort of running generally pushing the strain score over  and wods that are purely weightfocused at the lower endi also find that editing so that its just measuring the actual wod will bring a lower score versus letting it selfdetect the workout which will often include warmup and cooldowncurious if you all are seeing similar results,crossfit
hi everyonei’ve posted this question before but the majority of people didn’t actually read the post and just said “switch off auto pause” or “you’re accidentally hitting the two side buttons” so to make it clear i already have auto pause turned off and also the setting to pause the workout when you click both side buttons turned off when i’m training with the watch on whether it be high intensity interval training strength training or even outdoor run the watch randomly pauses without reason or warning and it’s driving me insane it also always pauses itself  seconds into the workout every time i’ve tried searching through google but with no success the only answer seems to be that the watch is loosing contact with the skin and to wear it tighter however i’ve been experimenting with the strap tightness and it happens even when it is so tight that it begins to hurt so i don’t believe this is the reasondoes anyone know why this might be happening and how to stop it thanks a lot,crossfit

hey guys i have a question for you recently i finished reading the navy seal fitness manual it says that best program to build strength is pyramid workout in which you decrease the reps and increase the weights and it should be done twice a week for every muscle group the suggested structure was like  sets of  reps do you agree or do you think that another way of programming such as  or  is bettersince strength is an important aspect of crossfit and furthermore being a good athlete i would like to hear your opinions on the subject thanks in advance,crossfit

we all have our own little traditions and rules we use at the gym whether its bending or adjusting competition rules or addressing something they dont normally deal with for me if you lose count of reps or sets the lower number is it rather do an extra set than one too few i also always keep a board or an abacus or poker chips to keep count because i forget constantly on olympic lifts in training especially variations i dont care about press out its harder than catching it cleanly so why would i penalize it sure in a comp or in technique training but if im working power if i can muscle snatch it thats good enough for me other than stuff like emom or tabata or boxing i always set timers for an extra  at the beginning for set up and when i do an emom i always end up doing the rep around the  mark each minute to make sure im getting it in the minute prior,crossfit

i would first like preface this with some background and humility i started crossfit in  prebok barefoot shoes ’s and all  at that time and years after it was either hit main site or do your local gyms workout of the day vary rarely were people seeking out additional programming then in  “day in the life of froning” comes out on youtube and everyone started doing “extra work” the rise of outlaw came and i’ll admit it i fell hard into the loop of trying to identify being a competitive crossfitter and doing  workouts a day it was pretty sweet getting free programming that you could compare with other top athletes at the time or just see how they crushed your dreams on the reg then came others like nclab i remember finding misfit and looking at their week of programming and thinking “this is the hardest shit that’s out there hands down” it all workskindauntil it doesn’t  when starting “competitive programming” as a relative novice meaning low skill set low oly numbers marginal engine this forces you to actually practice these things consistently so of course you get better then confidence starts to build then one day after your build to a heavy snatch part a  back squat part b emom of strict handstand push ups and pull ups you feel confident to hit the metcon at the end of heavy amandabut full snatches still aren’t your thing yet so you ugly power the og rx weights  and do bent arm muscle ups in singles and doublesit takes you close to  minutes to finish the next day your shoulders feel like they’re falling off and your low back is so stiff getting out of bed that you look like a zombie hobbling to the bathroom you check your instagram feed to see what your favorite athletes are doing and you see them crushing heavy amanda in sub  minutes the next training session you go in like a bat outta hell thinking “hwpo i’ve got to get better” and boom you get actually injured torn shoulder torn bicep ruptured disc torn meniscus or acl i’ve seen this time and time again and even experienced it myself ruptured  in  it blows my mind that there are gyms that follow comptrain as their regular class programming why just because they give out affiliate programming does not mean it’s right at the affiliate level most genpop crossfitters just want to be strong enough to do the activities they enjoy on the weekends and look good shirtless with the added health benefits that go along with gpp functional style training if you read that and it sounds like you please just realize just doing it to “challenge yourself” and you “love the burn” comes at a price also if this sounds like you and you’re consistently crushing workouts without major injury and have qualified for sanctionals or fingers crossed they bring back regionals congrats and i’m semi jealous of your ability to stay bulletproof 💪,crossfit

is this the way the competitive cf is going to go on the more casual leveli still think it should be about if not anything then at least about everything that a typical wod programming includes instead it seems everyone tries to cash in with qualifiers and low bar competitions where it feels more like strongman event than actual cfnow im not saying there should be half marathon long swim or such in anything but maybe the games but reality is more like this is a masters competition so we wont be having any of that mu or hsw nonsense here or there will be some skills required in actual competition but the qualifier is all heavy front rack lunges and gtohi understand that any real endurance is hard to test in open or most of the qualifiers due to required running track andor timeyeah it sometimes frustrates me that my strengths are considered something that would turn paying customers away from the event,crossfit
where can i find resources for online competitions  i’ve been training for comps but with covid it’s not really an option atm thanks,crossfit
 someone explain me about cfdoes it include all types of exercises like bodybuilding gymnastics agility etc i hav heard something  should i  ,crossfit
so long story short i got into crossfit over the quarantine no boxes have really opened yet for me to join i have a barbell and some plates and basically really suck at olympic lifts i need to work on the form hardcore before i feel comfortable throwing them into my training so i’m wondering if there is any olympic with wods thrown in on the back end to keep fit any help is greatly appreciated,crossfit
i have done power lifting for the past four years and have gained a decent amount of strength but i have gotten rather bored of the same old routine when it comes to programming is it worth trying crossfit even if i am not the most nimble person,crossfit

hey guys first post in this sub i joined crossfit in march coming from a mix of powerliftinggeneral strength trainingrunningswimming for a number of years i’m loving it and tend to go to  classes per week with a bit of running or swimming in between i don’t do any additional strength work now other than what comes up in classes this does mean however that one day we may do squats for example and then i may not train squats specifically for another  weeks although obviously there are other movements we do that involve the same muscles i’m not sure if this means i’m not really progressing much in terms of strength i feel my training is less structured but i do enjoy the conditioning aspect and the olympic lifts which are new to me am i doing crossfit ‘wrong’,crossfit
my brother and i are wanting to build a gym in our backyard for crossfit which he has been doing for  years and i have never done before we were considering getting a rogue ’ monster rig to do simultaneous workouts and i was just curious if there are any cheaper options to do this or for recommendations on attachments for the rig thank you for any advice,crossfit
hi everyonethank you to anyone who contributes this may be too vaguenuanced or personal for this forum and if so will delete with apologies i began attending a kickass crossfit box last november around  times a week prior i was as a total newbie to proper lifting my attendance goal is  times and i manage that now and then but average  sometimes it ends up at  if i need the recovery i often stay an hour or  later to get in some extra lifting practice or cardio im  female and small framed age  i have strong goals but wish to be realistic for my age i started off extremely underweight and having to rapidly put on about  pounds after surgery and prolonged bedrest to be stable enough to start exercising i was overseas at the time of my accident and put on weight in the worst way possible this was a couple years back but my recovery was slow i have since moved to america and had an extremely sedentary lifestyle before joining crossfit not to diverge into the sentimental but after my doctor essentially told me that i either get to gaining muscle now or give up any hope in hell of having a child and expect to suffer in ugly ways as i age i feel crossfit played a massive role in making my life livable nothing worked for me and i was hooked even if i cried my way through week  and felt like total shit in the beginning i owe my crossfit community more than they will ever know stuck with it and happy to say im nearly at my first pull up  just got my box jumps up to  inches from  and though i seldom can do a wod at true rx i feel awesome each time i show upmy diet was all over the place in the beginning i jammed myself with chicken and calories because my body cried out for it  often in extreme excess that left me feeling crappy and occasionally sick i put on a solid visible chunk of muscle and saw my body composition change dramatically but felt out of control and had constant indigestion my doctor was pleased and declined to formally refer me to a nutritionist so that my insurance could cover it as i dont have an eating disorder and my personal funds got tight i am looking to change doctors i began using the renaissance periodization rp app on the advice of my coach about  months ago this is where things got more confusing for a newbie like me who is grateful for health but tired of feeling out of control and seeking something sustainable that leads to the goals i have now that my health is in decent form i was advised by the app to begin with fat loss having over  body fat my muscle percentages using the withings comp scale is normal range i feel as if i just graduated into being a normal but reasonably fit person which is no small feat considering where i started my current goal is muscle gain and to get the fat gain under control  though i am aware its tough to do both im now at a normal weight fat level around  my coach advised ignoring the apps advice and seeking to gain as much mass as possible asap  he suggested  pounds the app doesnt allow to this it maxes out at  i gave that a shot for a month and felt uncomfortable in my skin and unsure if what i was doing was sensible for my workout intensity our wods seem to fall into light intensity category on the app even if i throw in a little extra i switched up to the maintenance setting on the app and then decided to try very slow fat loss to the degree the diet felt pretty normal thats where i am now and have been for the past month i feel confused as i am going against the advice of my coach not feeling like i am seeing much in terms of change have zero context and i fear sabotaging myself the way i did in the beginning i noted the post regarding protein vs caloric intake for novices and wondered if i ought to give posting a shot i realize my situation is nuanced but i gratefully welcome advice  on both the app and diet and the methods suggested to me my utmost gratitude to anyone who contributes if this post belongs elsewhere kindly let me know cheers,crossfit
me and my husband recently joined a local center we’ve been wanting to get into better shape but with covid and mask mandates it’s been difficult to get the motivation to go to the gym we recently were told about crossfit by one of his coworkers and she swears it’s amazing the one she was going to was offering a free first week trial so we kicked it on wednesday and again this morning now this past year i’ve been trying to make an effort to be more active and get my heart pumping on a daily basis but i didn’t really have anyone to instruct me or tell me what i was doing wrong man the exercise and workouts here are sooo intense and it actually pushes me to work harder than i thought i could do the instructors are amazing so welcoming and the community overall is very friendly i’ve come to like the idea of group fitness and i enjoy that they give you the options to do other workouts if you’re not comfortable doing stuff like the lifting and heavy weights my body is undeniably sore and i overall feel great about myself i think both me and my husband are going to benefit long term when we return and plan with cf if there’s any tips that you have to give us as new community members please feel free to let me know and we are looking forward to more,crossfit

i am a lurker on this sub enjoy reading the posts i have been cfing for  years i rx most movements and thrive on cardio… i am sharing my story to ask for input on my situation wednesday july  i completed the following wod at my box cf mayhem  cal  ghd sit  chest to  burpee over  ft single arm overhead lunge  to this workout i had been training core quire a bit and thought that i was ready for ghds… boy was i wrong the ghds hit me really hard and i was only able to make it through  reps before moving on i never skip reps i  will scale before skipping reps but i could not finish thesethe day after this wod i was sore but still went into the gym and worked out soreness was nothing out of the ordinary however over the next week my abs became increasingly sore to the point that i couldn’t do any physical activity so i  stayed out of the gym and just rested  days after the ghd wod i was still sore and tender in the abs so i went to my doctor and he prescribed anti inflammatories… they started working almost immediately and within  days i was feeling very good day  of anti inflammatories i decided to work out at home by myself doctor said as soon as i was pain free for a few days it was ok to workout just not core specific workouts it was very hot outside but still an enjoyable workout i did  rounds of  mile run  wall balls might have used the core too muchlater that night i started feeling terrible muscle aches all over my body headaches and fatigue this continued the next few days and i even had a fever off and on thought it might be covid but turned out negative later on i developed a pain in my groin and went back to doctor who said i had blood in my urine and that urine was infected so now i am on day  of antibiotics for infection wondering what the heck is going on still battling groin paininfection doctor does not believe it  could be rhabdo symptoms… and did not do blood work they ruled out kidney stones as well doctor does not seem to think the infection is related to exercise but i can’t help but think the two things are related what say you and how should i proceed with easing back into working out… i have learned my lesson on going too hard i know people will say “listen to your doctor” and i am going to do that but also interested in input of those who might have experienced something similar,crossfit

ive been training for  years and competed for several of those as a strongman but im in my  and am pretty beat up not even from that but from osteoarthritis a wreck in  that mangled my back amp hip several years in the military etc  i need to stop putting so much focus on raw strength and a little more on general health and longevity as theres nothing i enjoy more than training and would like to continue doing it for the rest of my lifei want to continue the main compound lifts but would like to supplement them with crossfit to improve overall fitness  however im locked into my current gym for another  months recently moved to a new city and the local crossfit box closed right after i got here so for the time being ill need to do it in a commercial gym  ive been researching for the last  weeks and have found several examples of metcons and tabatas and lots of mention of adding them to a training session but no good explanation of how to structure themwhat i mean is would it be better to pair a metcon with a similar lift for additional volume or with something else to fill it out  does it even matter  for example im looking at diane  of  dl and handstand pushups  would it be more beneficial to do these on a heavy deadlift session or something else like squatpressalso would additional cardio ie morning runsrucks hinder my ability to perform these sessions later lunch break  i see a lot of the pros doing multiple workouts a day but they have the years under their belt not to mention youth coaching and time on their hands,crossfit

let me preface this i have owned many pairs since they started i was in the very first preorder they debuted at ecc when it was basically just sam dancer and brooke ence wearing them they were different then simple design and very comfortable the faults start to appear after about a month of consistent use they get “floppy” and less supportive the appearance starts to look like they were packed away in a suitcase for a trip and they never regained their shape and this plays right into their marketing loop of releasing a new color way with no significant design enhancement i have not worn the runners or the lifters but based on the performance of the trainers i would be suspect of their longevity,crossfit

i have dropped a good chunk of change to get a good home gym and don’t have the appetite or garage space for an assault bike i’m sure i will get one eventually but in the mean time i’ve been using burpees as an assault bike substitute i think it’s a fair substitute since it is good cardio and incorporates pressing for arms and legs like an assault bike would it’s also an equally challenging exercise instead of something i find easier like jumping rope since my program calls for a fair bit of biking i end up doing a lot of burpees throughout the weeks which is pretty miserable i’ve been using one burpee equivalent to  cals on an assault bike do you think it’s closer to   cal or   cals thanks,crossfit

looking for a alternative to resistance bands im trying to avoid the uneven tension resistance bands create yet that the same time i need something compact for a very limited space at home and doesnt use a bunch of heavy free weights or plates to create the varied resistance im not sure what it would be called but if i were to try and describe it one possible solution would be some kind of cable that can be attached to any given wall mount on one end and a rope handle on the other in between would be some kind of smalllight weight mechanism that allowed the cable to unwind and rewind at various settable resistances at those resistances would remain the same thru out the full range ie  to say  lbs maybe moreso whats the name of the exercise equipment im looking for  thank you,crossfit
we have one of the biggest pandemics since  and on their website are posts on diabetes and recipes they should be posting recommendations about mask wearing at affiliates   my affiliate just opens the doors and turns on the fan and wipes down equipment and considers that safe    would be nice to see mask use being promoted in crossfit boxes but i dont think that is going to happen since crossfit hq thinks covid is a hoax and if its real it is only going to kill  percent of the population,crossfit

hello crossfitters ive  f recently moved and joined a new gym this particular gym was recommended by a friend and between my dropin class and my friends description it sounded like the right box for me i like a no nonsense atmosphere so that im motivated to do better there are a few other gyms closeby but the next best one seems like a very friendly encouraging environment where most members are working moms and dads and theyre welcome to bring their little ones i specifically avoided this gym since im not a parent and i dont want kids around distracting me while im trying to exercise and hear the coach fast forward to my second week there every single class had a minimum of two children ten year old age range attending class the kids were ofcourse doing a different workout and most of them were very new to any sort of exercise and therefore needed a lot of special attention and modifying on top of that obviously children tend to forget about social distancing and not touching their faces so there is that aspect as wellnow ive been crossfitting for about a year and a half but i am currently working through an injury so i would not say that im expecting a tonne of special attention but id like the coach to pass by once in a while and give me a form check or have an extra three minutes at the start of class to help me decide which moves to focus on and scale also i dont want to be a huge ahole but kids arent really my thing i dont hate them but im not enjoying working out in a class full of them any recommendations on how to handle this ive been considering simply trying to go to the later classes in the evening and see if there are any children then though i prefer morning or early afternoon workouts and if i still have no luck ill start thinking about finding a new gym do you think its worth talking to the owner i am brand new there and i dont want anyone thinking that im some sort of childhating jerk any advice would be appreciated even if its stop being a whiner and be happy that the next generation is trying to get out there and kill itthanks,crossfit

there is no phosphocreatine pcr energy system  pcr is a store and buffer of phosphates which are used for immediate resynthesis of atp   pcr is then replenished by oxidative mostly and glycolytic energy production  it does not organically produce atp so it is not an energy system  when the demand for atp exceeds the supply pcr goes down  it has absolutely nothing to do with the first  seconds or anything like that this decrease in pcr will occurs at any time in the workout when atp demand exceeds supply   pcr never runs out because it is resynthesized by the other energy systems mostly oxidative  capacity is determined by the interaction of the oxidative and glycolytic systems and its not the duration of the tasks that determines how it works  the two energy systems yep i said it  work independently but do interact more to come soon,crossfit

i just finished my first week of crossfit i did  wods and i have a couple of questionsobviously my wods were heavily scaled i used half or the rx weight for most of the wods to focus on form and to get me through the wod  and strengthbefore most wods we had a short session  that was focused on skill or strength how do you get stronger and better at movements with such limited time allocated to skill learning and strength the wod itself seemed like a very hard conditioning work out and definitely not a time to work on skill and strength or am i missing somethingthere is a weekly olly class which im planning on attending soon im assuming that once i get a grasp of the basic mechanics of the olympic movements ill be able to also work on my strength during these classesbut what about all the other movements how do you go from ring rows to pull ups to muscle ups with that little time to practice them to people work on them outside of class  leads me to my next question which is about scaling i understand how to scale weight but what about bodyweight exercises we had a wod the other day which had  chest to bars for  rounds in iti can do  strict pull up chin above bar but i cant do  of them neither do i know how to do the kipping variant so do i start with strict pull ups and when i fail switch to ring rows for the remainder of reps do i use a band thick enough to get me through the wodi know im just starting out so i think as time goes ill be better at estimating how to scale properly and still getting through the  during wodsmy last question is about the mental part i guess while doing the wod i was pushing hard and it was very hard for me to stay focused its like im in full fight or flight mode just steaming ahead and suddenly the wod is over and im kinda left with a what just happened feelingbeing in this state makes it really hard to focus on my form and pacing is this something that will get better with time does this mean im pushing too hard,crossfit

howdy folks i’m somewhat new to crossfit and new to this subreddit i’d appreciate any feed back i hope my post isn’t too much word vomit but here goes my bestso my fiancé and i decided to join a cf gym in our hometown together  we decided it would be a great way to challenge each other  she has also reached an issue with staying motivated and asked if i would start going with her  i’ve been to a few wods and i’m still learning the lifts and correct form i know that will come with more experience  she has been in the sport for maybe  years and has had a mixed results mostly due to her crazy work schedule it’s been really hard for her to buckle down and hit the gym as much as she needs too recently she has been more into olympic lifting and goes two a lifting coach  a week she also work  shift  hours  so it’s difficult for her to handle everything  i on the other hand work less hours my commute is shorter and i have a lot more free time on my hands  my question to the community is for those of you who are couples the crossfit together i want to see my partner through this challengewhat are some pointers on how to support my partner better during our crossfit journeythanks,crossfit
a buddy of mine is the type of person that needs a big event or challenge on his calendar in order to be motivated to train and stay in shape i proposed a large endurance workout that we could do partner style to give him something to shoot for im hoping to get some feedback on my proposed workout the wod would be a spinoff from murph we would start with a  split the murph movements and then finish off with another  hes more of a runner than lifter and i have limited equipment so thats what i came up with any feedback or suggestions would be welcomed with open armsthanks,crossfit

i’ve been on and off crossfit for the last  years but recentlyish found a box where i just absolutely love the programming and the people late july  i dislocated my left shoulder while hiking took  weeks of physical therapy and a month after i went back to the gym on november  i worked really hard to build shoulder strength gradually was always aware of my bad shoulder always reminded my coaches and scaled down the weight on turkish getups and anything that demanded single arm overhead with weightwe get back to the now and i’ve had zero problems  minus the fact that i’m  months pregnant  but still modifying like a boss and feeling great we do kettlebell windmills and i severely scale down because although my arm is locked out there’s a bit movement there  so i substitute a dumbbell instead of a kettlebell just so it feels more balanced and only use  lbs i’m a tiny girl so even at  months pregnant i’m only  lbs so it wasn’t a ton of resistance when put in perspective on the  set i feel a small pop in my shoulder and i knew i was done not really any pain  not really much trauma  i just take my dumbbell down with my good arm though i absolutely knew that my shoulder was fucked again after setting it back in place and talking to a sports doctor he didn’t think i was doing anything too terribly wrong  he said it was probably more due to a previous dislocation b joints loosening much more than normal while pregnant due to extra relaxini guess i’m just looking for advice i’ve heard all the horror stories of how it just gets worse with every dislocation and i’m just getting demoralized and honestly getting fearful that i’ll never be able to workout without fear that i’ll dislocate again and increase my chances even more for the next one it sucks to literally have to do this tango of taking several months off again for pt and then back to square  on all my lifts because oh y’know you need to be even on both shoulders to start going for  rep maxes any insights are appreciatedjust super bummed,crossfit
hi everybody i started cf june  i am loving it yesterday we did bs before the wod and it was the first time i felt comfortable going heavy and trying to find my rm i am noticing that at heavier weights my form is not right my coach said i am moving my back at the bottom and loosing power before i was bouncing in the cradle and i fixed that but now this i did notice that i felt my weight in my heels on the way down but it moved to the balls of my feet on the push up today my back is really sore mid back at the bottom of my shoulder blades we also did thrusters burpees and rowing yesterday and my dumb ass was hunched over sorting mtg cards for hours last night so i’m sure the back pain wasn’t just the back squats any helpful tips or insights into where i’m going wrong my coach said my form with the empty bar is really good,crossfit

what do you think the minimum  on each of the following lifts need to be at before youd say the person could probably consistently rx the daily wods assume that the conditioning is already there so were not just talking about some  guy who can lift insane amounts i picked the lifts below and excluded things like clean amp jerk and snatch because im also assuming the technique is there so if these lifts are on then they can snatchjerk enough im curious what the male numbers would be but feel free to throw on female amounts as wellback squatfront squatdeadliftbenchstrict presspower clean,crossfit
tldr gym forced new membership on me no more crossfit more expensive wondering what peoples thoughts are on the change of membership enforced on all members of my gym post covid and see if anyone elses gyms have had to change i used to pay £ a month for unlimited access classes included crossfit sampc intervals endurance and strongman it was epic i loved it we received an email a few weeks ago telling us that the membership had changed everyone would be put on a membership for £ a month and that would give access to  intervalhiit type workouts a week and  open gym slots if you want you can add on one focus clsss a week for an extra £ a month or  for £ these would be small classes of no more than  people if you want access to any programming such as strength or performance it costs an extra £ per programme however this would be included if you choose an add on my new cost would be £ a month for  classes a week im quite annoyed by this as it also appears were not even affiliated anymore so no crossfit i have given feedback but was told tough basically im still miffed a few weeks later so maybe im just overreacting thoughts,crossfit

 am constantly in a battle of contrasts especially myself because i have a history when it comes to fitness and all the things that are associated with iti was overweight when i was young got bullied and rejected for it it happened a long long time ago and i have delved with a lot of therapy and selfhelp to get over those dark times but even though i have managed to find a way to be above these troubles those demons linger in the back of my mindi still suffer from selfdoubt being selfconscious about my weight my looks my diets and everythingsometimes i am not sure if i am being disciplined and dedicated or whether i am being obsessed and unhealthy because unfortunately i went through an eating disorder at a very young age and even those demons still linger every now and thensometimes i feel like that i need to eat a lot to maintain my size and to gain muscle plus being a foodie i find this a plussometimes i feel the need to make sure that i am keeping myself in check and constantly doubting my habits because i am not sure if i am doing things right or i am being obsessed or making myself unhealthy or following a fitness fadsometimes i want to be sure that i am doing things right because i know how the fitness industry tries to profit from all the insecurities and misconceptions about fitness or mainstream thought continue to push inaccurate or misinformed beliefs about fitnesssometimes i feel like i am in a battle between wanting to accept myself as i am because i am aware that people have their own body types and ways of living while also finding out if i should better myself even though i know that the socalled “ideal body type” changes from time to time and shifts and changes depending on the trends or whatever hollywood body is the most famoussometimes i want to stick to my diet and exercise routine to be consistent disciplined and mature about my goals and desires sometimes i feel that i should be flexible and not as strict and expose myself to other ideas and even other foods and ways of living because life is too short to live in one way and i wish to experience it like an adventure worth livingwho knew that something so simple as losing weight or staying healthy can be so mentally taxing and so damn complicated that trying to balance it all is like an overly complicated game of chess,crossfit

i recently joined a couple weeks ago after going to free classes for a couple weeks and i have to say that the box i go to is hands down the best gym i have ever been to i am someone whose weight has fluctuated his entire life i will be fit for a couple years get too comfortable and become overweight and then repeat cycle well now i am technically obese so my friends who have down crossfit for years finally convinced me to join their box and i love it i am no stranger to fitness lifting but i have just lost touch with it recently the people are genuinely nice and the owner of our box is one of the coolest and fittest people i have met his wife is exactly the same i don’t feel stupid or discouraged from having to scale more than half of the lifts exercises random people constantly boost my self esteem by telling me great job fist bumps etc of course there are a few people who most would consider gym douches but those are literally at every gym the workouts are some of the most intense workouts i’ve ever done and the feeling of accomplishment is unmatched i usually feel pretty nervous before going to class because i know there’s a decent chance i will puke from the intensity but once i’m done i feel more accomplished than i do after my work day is finished i really hope this becomes a lifestyle for me because i only see benefits so far,crossfit

   im immunocompromised so im feeling pretty angry about all this since our gym reopened the only thing they have done is purchase mops some handsanitizer and fabuloso in spray bottles  the idea is that members wipe down equipment and mop the floor its basically dry mopping with a sponge     hardly anyone does this and im fairly certain regular fabuloso isnt a disinfectant   no one wears masks ever  even my partner only wore one when  i was there and id force him because its  too difficult  i basically had to threaten him and this is after ive already had a weeklong stint in the hospital earlier this year     i have even taken to bringing my own disinfectant and wipes and working by myself in a corner  so about a month ago our gym had a smaller competition still around  ppl  again no one wore masks  a friend of mine went with cold symptoms the next day tested negative two days later tested positive the gym owner did not announce the possible exposure during this  i really felt like i couldnt speak  to the gym owner especially when i was pressured by friends and family not to  start anything and i barely speak to her on a regular basis since i hardly ever take her classes and no one really chats at the  am class  i also want let you know my partner and i get a discount on our membership that makes me feel like i cant say anything then two weeks ago my regular coach is diagnosed hes out still no announcement just a subbed in coachthen last week huge competition i find out that an attendee that i know knew he was covid pos and wentthen he took his mask off because he felt silly  all pictures show zero social distancing at the event masks on ears competitors with no masks at all huggingthis week the sub coach laughs about how she is sick can barely breathe and doesnt feel well after attending competition shes a teacher she isnt a mask wearer she doesnt want to get tested    i went on instagram and todays our gyms community free class day no one masked group photo of     so i look on social media some more and no gyms in our area have masks and so many group photos      how do i talk to the gym and community about this  what is with florida what would you do how does your box handle it how do i bring up this conversation  i am a huge introvert if you couldnt tell by my posting this on reddit first  i know a safer environment is possible i go to a climbing gym and they do things like take your temp at the door  sanitizing stations every couple of feet fewer people allowed in uv light filtration in the ac when they got a covid exposure there they announced it immediately called all people who were there at the time shut the gym down for  hours while they cleaned and then had uv lights spotlighted everywhere during they pulled down every single hold then sanitized and powerwashed them,crossfit

hi everyonerecently i joined a crossfit box my main motive was because they have a very good olympic weightlifting department and offer a lot of classes in the process i realised my conditioning was not on par so instead of doing olympic weightlifting only i decided to also do some crossfit classes i really like that there is a lot of variety in the exercise we do and the many many ways in which the hiit is incorporated in the wods lately ive been having trouble finding motivation to push myself throughout the wods and it almost feels like an obstacle to go to the box and do the wodalso after the wod i am just absolutely drainedsince i prefer olympic weightlifting over crossfit fail to understand other peoples reasons for crossfit a lot of people at the box seem to favour crossfit over weightlifting for me its the other way around so i was wondering why do you guys love crossfit andor dislike olympic weightlifting,crossfit

today i did helen and i finished in  i did my kbs all in sets of  i did my first two sets of pull ups unbroken and i finished the last one in  im feeling great about it honestly i started crossfit  years ago my first year of crossfit i focussed on losing weight which helped me losing around  lbs this past year i mostly focussed on building strenght and gaining more weight gained around  lbs my waist circumference didnt change much thankfully so im happy about how i gained  weeks ago i started a new diet because of covid i lacked tracking my macros so i felt like it was time to up my game again even though  weeks isnt that long and  isnt super impressive as an helen time it feels like im on the right track especially over the course of  years this post is just me sharing a story and me telling myself to keep pushing harder 🤭,crossfit
  first off i dont train crossfit but i have worked out for several decades using similar explosive movements and strength training   that said all of these guys and girls that are in crossfit games are absolute beasts they are all very muscular very lean and they are operating at extremely high output this is what makes me go hmmmm  i know what its like to get much leaner while trying to keep muscle mass its difficult but very doable if you are dedicated but i also know how my performance suffers the leaner i get im not even that close to being as shredded as these crossfit games competitors though i have been around gyms for long enough to know what people can achieve naturally and what they cannot  are all of these crossfit games athletes just complete genetic freaks or are they genetic freaks that also  take steroids and other performance enhancers obviously they are super dedicated to their craft but theres something ekse going on there  the womens physiques in a  year span have changed dramatically they went from looking like fitness model types to nfl running backs lol again these women are not only very muscular but shredded and i know how difficult this is to accomplish when your estrogen is high and testosterone isnt   i know crossfit dies test its athletes but dont have to release the results to anyone seems occasionally a crossfit athlete tests positive but its not like  of athletes are failing drug tests id love to know if they are drug tested at the crossfit games   what is your stance on crossfit and steroids do you think they are all on something and just know how to pass the tests or maybe they truly are very dedicated genetic freak types,crossfit

i’m on my fourth week of doing crossfit i really love it i can understand the addiction of course olympic lifting is very new to me however i noticed after doing a long clean and press and clean and jerk exercise yesterday that today i ended up with some bruising at the front of my shoulders i’m assume it’s because when i got more tired i was letting the barbell slam down a little too hard has this ever happened to anyone is this normal for a noob i also know i took an nsaid the night before for a headache which may have delayed the clotting factors in my blood i’ll try not to take an nsaid the night before i don’t think i’m lifting too heavy maybe i am i believe my form was good i use the training barbell with  plates so  total at the end i am a bit more tired though any advice would be great just wondering if i might be doing something wrong i’m afraid if i go lighter with the weight it would be too easy because at the start it feels just right any tips on bringing the bar down slower i don’t mind some bruising but i want to make sure i’m doing everything i should we have good coaches always correcting us too thank you so much,crossfit

i am ’  lbs and about  body fat i’m reasonably muscular i started doing crossfit  months ago i feel amazing my energy levels are through the roof but in the two months that i’ve been doing crossfit i have lost  pounds a lot of which is muscle i’ve hired a nutrition coach to get my diet right my goal is to gain muscle mass  he’s saying that perhaps because of my body type and my goal crossfit is too high intensity that perhaps i should go with strictly lifting heavy low reps with a bit of steady state cardio in the mix along with a high protein high calorie diet i’m gonna stick with crossfit for now because i’m just beginning his diet he says that if i consume enough calories and protein that i could still gain muscle mass even though i’m training crossfit five times a week but that it’s a possibility that to reach my goal of gaining muscle mass i may have to go back to traditional weight lifting my question is is it possible to gain a significant amount of lean muscle mass with crossfit my goal body type is something like that of a crossfit games athlete,crossfit

i don’t know why i’ve never agreed with this technique but i’ve always felt like passing the db from one hand to the other on the way down on a db snatch or clean is wrong it’s a terrible technique to teach beginners an alternative is to return the weight to the floor and then change hands yes i know the purpose of the exercises is to get the weightimplement to an overhead position  you’re not completing the entire rep for that  on higher rep and grip intensive workouts you’re risking dropping the db on the exchange  a dumbbell is not a barbell and these are not near max loads so no reason to release the weight maybe i’m wrong change my mind,crossfit
a gym i have a membership at is asking members to pay an additional  members are billed weekly if they are financially able to do so this is obviously in response to a drop in membership due to covid personally i am financially blessed and it would not cause me financial hardship to pay extra i also tend to be a charitable person but i’m a realist  i seriously doubt that even a handful of members paying extra is going to keep the ship afloat and any extra money i pay them will be wasted as the gym would likely closed regardless so what would rcrossfit do is it appropriate to ask the owner what sort of shortfall they are experiencing to gauge whether or not this is a good use of my money do i blindly give out of the goodness of my heart and hope it works out is there another way i should look at this dilemma,crossfit
ive been doing crossfit for about  months now ive been going for about  days a week and and have been really enjoying it theres a run club in my box where people do a group run that is  miles or so once a week ive been going on a few of these runs and im getting side stitches and calf tightness by the  mile mark and find myself walking a lot on the last few miles of these  are a lot of things i want to work on weightlifting gymnastics double unders etc but i really want to supplement my wods with additional running in addition to these runs i find myself getting gassed most of the time from our metcons as opposed to being strength limitedi want to prioritize going to crossfit because i enjoy the social interaction the variety of movements and just from the large amount of areas i want to improve in being new is there a smart way i can incorporate additional running training so i can complete these  mile runs in this run group without taking walking breaks,crossfit

so ive been thinking about joining a local crossfit gym for a while and im honestly still on the fence the financial cost is high and i just am worried about being the newbie stupid i know i recently went through a bad break up blah blah blah and generally have felt disappointed in my lack of strength regardless of the shitty break up its felt like a sort of wake up call for things ive failed to address for a while particularly my mental and physical wellbeing im at the point where im tired of neglecting my body and mind i recognize my past lack of self care iswas not sustainable so here we are at the point that i am  committed to a lifestyle change not solely a physical change im committed to finding a community that is supportive not only of my physical but also of my mental wellbeing ive been an athlete all my life and as a typea personality it is easy for me to become compulsive competitive and consumed by my body image and strength performance what i ultimately want is to find a community or trainer that can help me build my self confidence and overall strength while promoting good eating habits im not a complete newbie to the movements front squats rdls bulgarian split squats barf etc i enjoy these high intensity workouts so i think a crossfit gym would be helpfulso ladies or dudes im wondering whether any other women have faced these mental physical challenges and whether you found a crossfit community to be beneficial in your health journey have you found crossfit to exacerbate any negative eating behaviors or body images,crossfit

ive been looking for a new box recently as gyms are just being allowed to reopen in my area ontario and i moved since the pandemic started since cases are currently low and crossfit class sizes are small im feeling comfortable enough to go back my main frustration is out of the  gyms in my area only one or two actually listed pricing information on their website i messaged the other gyms through their website and most wouldnt give me the info until i told them my exercise history and what my goals were is this common with crossfit gyms in other areas i can see why some places might worry that people potentially interested might be scared off because crossfit style training is pricey but for me i value transparency and making it difficult for a prospective member to actually determine how much a gym might cost or for members to figure out how much their costs vs other gyms in the area i makes me feel like not being transparent about your pricing feels like a bit of a red flag,crossfit

so im a relatively tall guy around  or  and have been doing crossfit for about  years now after around  years of bodybuildingisolated weight lifting when first starting with cf i had quite a few issues with mobility due to my height and lack of flexibility but ive managed to improve on that eg do deep squats proper form cleans etchowever one thing i am still really struggling with is shoulder mobility whenever i have to tilt my torso forward just a little bit in any type of overhead movement i lose almost all strength and integrity not sure whether thats the right term this really shows in oh squats and snatches but i think it affects my gymnastics as well as i cannot get a proper full range swing going especially singlehand overhead work is really a struggle more so than overhead barbell worki have asked around at different boxes and tried quite a few different type stretches and generally try to involve some form of overhead work in my programming at least once a week but somehow im not seeing real improvement any tips or experiences on improving shoulder mobility for overhead work would be greatly appreciated thanks,crossfit
hi im  and fell in love with crossfit a couple years ago after three months of paying  i realized that i simply could not afford it i asked the owner if i could potentially clean the gym in exchange for a membership and he said yesive been a janitor there ever since cleaning about  hours a week i have my own key and get to workout whenever i want its awesome however it made me realize that this payformat simply is not accessible to most people one of my dreams is to open a box but i would love to make it accessible to people with low incomes ive been exploring the idea in my head i wonder if it would be possible to build some form of sliding membership scale like pay what you can well get the difference further more we could ask wealthier members to cover membership costs for members who struggle financially the crossfit community is so fucking cool and i really think some people i know would jump on a chance to fund a members journey its like a crossfit coopanyway im just kind of exploring the idea any one have any thoughts on the plausibility of this can it be donei dropped out of college and truthfully have no idea what the fuck im talking about but im passionate about this and want to learn more,crossfit

i have been part of the crossfit community since retiring from the navy in   i became addicted  to the movements people community and lifestyle  my life was reinvented  i quit the job i hated found a job i loved completed my second college degree made new lifelong friends and competed multiple local box competitions that brings me to last week   we were completing the nicole benchmark  i subbed out the running for  echo bike because it was there and was doing  pullups per round not trying to kill it just wanted to maintain  while doing my  round my grip slipped  i don’t know what happened after that except that the back of my head hit the floor  according to the coach the sound of my head hitting the floor was louder than the music  i was out for about a minute  i woke but i do not remember anything until standing next to my gym bag  multiple friends asked to drive me to the hospital and home i shot down every request like a fool i have since apologizedi drove to work and then the local er  they gave me a ct scan and told me that i have a  inch crack in the back of my skull a minor bleed and bruising on the brain  an overnight stay and another ct determined that the bleed had stopped but i was kept for  more days for observation  it has been a week since my release  i have treatment scheduled for the local tbi clinic and occupational therapy there are ok days and bad days  no good one yet  the world is a weird fog sometimes  my heart aches for those who i have affected negatively because of this family coach friends gym ownermanageri know i should listen to the doctors but is there anything that i can do in the meantime in terms of exercise  this is one of the toughest mountains that i have had to climb and i could use the advice  i owe it to those closest to me to come out of this stronger and smarter  thank you,crossfit

i could use some home programming advice please  i did a few months of cf at the box near me until covid home a couple months just doing bodyweight stuff and whatever i could do with the pair of  dumbbells and the  kettlebell i had until the gym opened back up  was fun getting back into it a month and instead of just doing the newbie stuff that was mostly like any other hiit bootcamp we started adding in a barbell strength portion everyday seemed to be floor press deadlift front or back squat hang power clean and then maybe db snatches or lunges on the  day each week  i noticed myself getting stronger at those since i hadnt tried much of that since being at a traditional gym  but now im back at home waiting to see what happens with gyms and covid  im expecting im home awhile so now ive got a squat rack with spotter arms and a bench more weight than i can deadlift jump rope heavier dumbbells and a heavier kettlebell on the way a slam ball and a wall ball  i got a little crazy and grabbed a rower and a bike both on the way as well thinking even when the gym is back open id like to do supplemental stuff at home since the open gym hours dont work at all with my real life schedulemy goals are simple  get stronger while getting leaner and improving my endurance ive noticed my resting heart rate and active recovery were improving the first few months at the gymmy stats   male middleage cant run long distances anymore but can do  and  runs down the block vegetarian take protein shakes daily to compensate   gt  deadlift  back squat probably higher but will try tomm  bench all pretty lightweight honestly   body fat last time i got an inbody back in feb im sure the same or a little lower now  my belief is i want to get that down  to get the more toned look im hoping for since i can see the muscles are there from putting in a lot of work but im also still at beginner lift weights so i dont really know whether putting in more cardio on the bikerower and keeping up the metcons for the enduranceheart is a good thing or going to make it hard for me to lift any heavierwhat ive been doing is following along with the gyms wod since i stopped going in so theres a short warmup then a strength portion of  lift lets say  or  or whatever each day and then a metcon  if i dont have the listed equipment i sub in something and since i dont want to run long distances ive been subbing in stuff like kb snatches for some of those until more gear shows up  since im not spending the time talking to people and listening to a coach that i would in the gym im finding that all goes by quickly so im adding in a second lift or some stretching or ill lookup a core wod and throw that on the end to get me to a full  hourthats more than i intended to write but there it is  i would super appreciate programming advice as far as to keep increasing the weight while not losing out on metcons and what i get from the cardio theres heart disease and diabetes in the family history so i working hard to avoid all that  while im working from home for the foreseeable future while covid is out there im not even above continuing my early morning garage workouts and then doing supplemental work in the evening i was picturing myself spending  minutes doing tabatas or whatever on the bike or rower each day  thanks,crossfit

a couple that come to mind for me im not super chatty at my box which is a departure for me in real life so this is just stuff that a coach took time out of class to come over and tell me randomly these arent any pearls of wisdom or something that is a movieesque battle cry they just meant a lot to me on a personal  i dont think you need the  wall ball anymore ha minor but this nudge to stepup to the  wall balls which was programmed as rx for most of our work was a breakthrough for me to begin pushing myself and stop settling for what i had gotten comfortable  youve really come a long way just to hear that about six months into my journey unsolicited after a workout from a coach i respect  i just nodded and said thanks  but hell with all the struggles id been through inside and outside the realm of crossfit  it meant the worldanyway im sure theres been more enlightening and eloquent messages from coaches you may have encountered so im anxious to hear them,crossfit

so i think i should elaborate a bit before i go into the main issue of the subject  i have a bit of a lovehate relationship with fitness it is both a blessing and a curse especially considering that i have never really considered myself to be the athletic or the jock typeand unfortunately i have a bit of a history when it comes to fitness  years ago  years ago i unfortunately have gone through an eating disorder and despite that i managed to find a way to overcome the demons of said mental disorder the temptations and demons are still continuously larking in the back of my mind tempting me to go back to my old ways especially when i get serious about fitness where the issue of discipline counting macros and following a plan as it is a tricky process of trying to be aware where you are jumping between the realm of disciplinepassion or the realm of unhealthy obssession because the line that divides the two are pretty blurryat the same time fitness has helped me a lot  throughout all of my life i have gone through many many many unfortunate events  trauma ptsd depression anxiety and so onand fitness through the idea of mental toughness discipline and pure raw willpower has helped me to slowly embody these traits of selfassurance confidence and mental strength but at the same time much like everyone else it can be tricky to find the right motivation and discipline to push through and even find the motivation to go to the gym early or find the time to work out despite the pressures of life work school personal stuff family etc especially myself where i constantly have to battle against obstacles of mental health issues that block my path towards peak mental focus i practice mindfulness and take therapy so they do help even though they involve their own challengesand fitness despite its benefits is not an easy task persisting through the sheer pain and fatigue makes me feel like a rock and the feeling of endorphins pumping my veins make me feel tough and masculine but it is very mentally demanding especially crossfit because i need a little bit of time to mentally prepare myself to be as focused as possible to avoid injury exhaustion and so onand whenever i think of fitness i have this impression that i swore an oath of sorts  the desire to continue despite the pressure the willpower to persist despite the overwhelming obstacles the strength to overcome whatever challenges that come in your way mental or physical and going through the mentally demanding tasks of persisting through own personal mental challenges and the challenges of life is not an easy task to have enough energy and enthusiasm to work out as well sometimes i am awfully careful of whether i am working out because i want to or because i have to reminiscent to my dark ed daysi have only started working out for about  weeks and i know that noticing changes takes time and i have already been feeling mentally fatigued and as though my mind is overwhelmed with the challenges of my heart and soul some days i manage to overcome the psychologically draining nature of depression and anxiety other times the challenge is so overwhelming that i decide to skip the workout for another day because i felt that i do not have enough strengthbut lately i have been skipping a lot of workouts  the challenge to mentally prepare myself is becoming too much and i do not want to risk injuring myself and then i end up in another crossroad  whether skipping a workout or taking a break is a good thing or whether i taking the path of the easy way out and cowardice it makes me feel guilty to take the second path but i somehow feel deep in my gut that i do not take it i might risk making myself worse in the long run or worse finding it hard to focus on working out while dividing my energy on keeping my mind focused and undistracted at the same time it  is a mentally demanding task to keep up all of this and these tricky crossroads happen to me all the time but now the challenge of pushing myself to go to the gym despite the challenges is proving to be too much and despite that i often deliberately choose not to go to the gym out of the fear of taking the risk but i deep down feel guilty nonetheless as though i broke my promise to continue to push through despite the  aside of all this  aside of the overly complicated story that i just told when is it the right time to purposefully to be a break from working out,crossfit

hi guysmy gym is finally reopening in a few weeks and per my county mandate masks must be worn while exercising inside they are going to have outdoor options in the parking lot with distancing so hopefully i can do that too i was just wondering for those of you who are already back at the gym if there are certain kinds or brands of masks you find to be comfortable or at least bearable to wear while working out additionally no cardio is allowed so i’m guessing the workouts will be strength training and formskill work based so i won’t be sucking wind in the mask any tips or advice greatly appreciated,crossfit

so i’ve been lifting since junior high and because of that all of my major lifts are pretty high however my snatch is abysmal in comparison to my other lifts and i wanted to know if your snatch max increases based off of how well your physical fitness is or is there a strategic way to increase your strength in this lift i ask that question the way i did because i understand snatches incorporate your entire body into the lift so i assumed becoming physically fitter would equate to a stronger snatch,crossfit

 hi guys  i have been working out at homeback yard for the last three months now i like to keep my workouts as intense as possible and without the supervision of an experienced trainer apparently i am very prone to hurt myself  i have been experiencing knee pain for the last two weeks now i havent exactly stopped leg work went to the lower impact side of things i normally love my hiit workouts with a lot of jumping and even though to a lesser degree i still have the pain there  i will see a doctor tomorrow about this but i am nine months in my fitness routine i have been through smaller issues and a kinda bad back pain and i went through them just fine what i want to know is whether its normal to have occasional tiny injuries without them turning into longterm damage does anyone with a longer experience in the area can vouch for that or am i doing something horribly wrong  the other thing is it really bummed me out the idea of an injury has ruined me for the last two weeks i like getting stronger and getting better and i like doing it better than other people i like the idea that i can push myself further than other people even care to try i like the concept of putting my sweat and my blood into what i do and i am afraid a steady and slower concept is a must for staying injuryfree like i am careful with my form my trainers always approved of it too but i also try doing things that i cannot do until i can do them which basically means not being totally in control of my bodys positioning in unfamiliar exercises and shaky landings in explosive movements and stuff like that and i always thought it was okay my body would be able to handle that bit of error can it not  i am not native and i am horribly sleepdeprived so i really hope this whole thing doesnt sound like total gibberish and my sentences are clear enough,crossfit

ive been using the beyond the white board app for around  months now  i have switched to being a garage gymer the last few monthsi have just become aware of some of the public tracks on the app dumbells only wod fitness wod and performance wod  these tracks are all free to btwb subscribers and are excellent for gpp  i think online programming is usually lacking in coaching each one of these wods has a video brief going over the workout the strategy the movements and intended stimulus  it does not feel like they are just mailing it in and throwing a wod on the wall with no guidancei havent tried any of the btwb add on programs like the snatch cj handstand walk but im sure they are similarthese are all gpp tracks designed for health and fitness not the competitor  i think they are great and wanted to share,crossfit
tldr  relatively new to crossfit really fatigued in evenings after early morning wods but im trying hard to do the right thingsi started crossfit in march after strictly lifting for about  months at my local bigbox theres quotes around started because i literally got through the basics introductory classes to go through core movements etc and then attended my first official class at the beginning of march the day after my first class all the gyms were closed due to the pandemic im your average looking guy with little muscle tone but relatively healthy not new to fitness but picking it back up this year used to strictly run a lot in college sports in high school etcduring the closed time i continued to support my gym with my membership and our owner programmed and sent us daily workouts to perform he let me borrow a  db and  kb based on my beginner skill level and strength i did  of those wodstyle home workouts per week and complemented that with regular pullup sessions and dubs practice with my ropemy gym reopened day after memorial day may  and i hit the ground running excited to really get started unfortunately ive found myself just incredibly fatigued in the evenings  of my workout days to the point that i dont really want to get up the next day for the early class does my body just need to get used to this level of intensityive been going  per week to the  class these are wods that i enjoy for the variety usually consisting of a strength piece followed by a metcon piece i know others who go  per week who are older seem to have relatively the same level of fitness as i do and id like to go more if  male   yrsdiet  prior to a workout ill have a huel mix  scoop huel  cup coffee and a splash of milk postworkout some kind of recovery drink  gatorade breakfast  usually a bagel w spread banana cup of coffee lunch noon leftovers from dinner yesterday fairly diverse things like pasta dishes rice stir fry dishes fish tacosfajitas casseroles normal homemade dishes usually incorporating at least some veggies with protein dinner  see lunch water at least  oz per day most times more on days i work outsleep nights before workouts i go to bed between  and  i wake up at  on workout days nights before rest days i go to bed between  and  i wake up at  on rest days naps seem to not be an option for me they make me feel terrible when i wake up and it takes me a good amount of time to fall asleep for one anywaysother recovery i use the gowod app focus posterior chain i do the postwod roll  and and daily flow stretches  on workout days i do the daily flow stretches  on rest days i try to do some light jump rope active recovery on rest dayslifestyle i have a desk job so im rather sedentary for  hrs per day outside of my gym  appreciate anyones help im really trying hard i wouldnt normally vomit out all this info but ive been experimenting with a bunch of different variables with little change in my fatigue levels in the evenings i know its entirely possible that ive only been doing this fulltime for  and that my body isnt adjusted yet just wanted to poll the community thanks ahead of time,crossfit
what programming do all of the garage athletes in here use is there any groups or other online support to stay  i am now a working out at home athlete instead of attending my previous crossfit box they changed their schedule after they were closed for corona and i just cant make it work with my schedule the also refuse to do any sort of social distancing of any type so i guess i am out for a  was perfect for me talking to people and having the peer pressure to do a hard workout is what i really needed to stay fit has anyone else transitioned back to working out alone how did you stay motivated and  have a nearly complete garage gym so equipment shouldnt be an issue the issue is i have owned this stuff for like  years and barely ever use it,crossfit

so i have been doing crossfit on and off for the past  years i hate it and love it at the same time best shape i have ever been in was when i was consistently going to crossfit i also heavy lift powerlift etc the prices are just too steep for me atm even if i did a drop in once a week itd be  and i dont really see the point of going just once a week im considering firing off emails to local gyms and asking if they have some kind of lower rater maybe like  week or something has anyone been able to talk down their membership prices in my area unlimited is  which imo is steep for training that isnt even one on one might get some backlash from that last comment but ive been to  gyms and i felt i wasnt getting enough attention in all of them and dont feel that the price is worth it but again my opinion and yours may vary so please dont take it personally,crossfit
hii starter crossfit and i am really enjoying it im just a regular guy age  not super athletic and not in shape but im up for trying new things and improving myselfall of a sudden a few minutes ago as i was looking at a facebook post from our clubgymbox and i saw a picture of the whiteboard listing the times and reps of people my time is the worst of everybody im not there to break records or be the best crossfitter yet i am feeling a bit stupid and inadequate when i see my time compared with others maybe i dont belong with these much better athletic and in shape peoplefeeling humbled and inadequatedoes it matter that i am so relatively bad at this,crossfit

okay long story short i started at my box in september and i was   a week until december i started of so small because i have a chronic back injury dyspraxia hypermobility and im overweight not to mention a whacky drug cocktail to manage all of it but then i fell in love with crossfit i could do it eg i started by doing step ups on a  weight so what a few inches high then built up to the boxes then weighted with boxes i lost  and dropped two dress sizes from the exercise alonei am so grateful to my box i joined classes full time in december and did the  christmas workouts carried on happily until march and lockdown went into it doing home workouts but gradually lost motivation my dog would go ballistic and id be too noisy for those i live with so lost my mojo id started worrying id have lost all my progress and my embarrassment was making me feel like giving up but instead i started walking more and more i walked  since lockdown started and i started a keto diet i realised i missed crossfit and decided i wanted to stick to it knowing it would be hardand today i did my first session and overhead barbell work and managed the whole thing including the hellish final  minutes workout i managed better than i did before lockdown actually and it feels so good despite my thighs being on fire i feel ive finally committed and my life style is miles better and it is staying this way for as long as possible i dont see myself giving up anymore i just wanted to share my mini victory i posted here at the start and you all encouraged me so kindly i still have a lot of progress to make but ive started again i feel happy for the first time since march if anyone is struggling with thoughts of starting at a box again get out there its where youll find your people and if i can do it you can too,crossfit
hey everyone pretty new to crossfit and this page  i was wondering if anybody has any recommendations of good boxes in london i am moving flat soon so relatively open but would prefer something in either the south east or west context joined a box on a foundation month in march which was cut three weeks in due to covid have since been continuing to pay monthly support but have decided that i won’t be going back based on a few reasons lack of communication being the core issue looking to find a box where there is a good level of coaching and ideally at least a few of the members compete at a good level to learn from and eventually go to competitions with would be looking to work on skill as much as possible therefore would hope that the programming isn’t purely based on killing yourself every session and  has a reasonable amount of open gym time to perfect skillsmany thanks and any suggestions are appreciated,crossfit

full disclosure i was am and will always be a westside barbell fanboy  i started lifting in  and when i started “researching” on the internet the only way to train for strength was to “do westside barbell” so that’s what i grew up with and it will always hold a special place in my heart  because of that when i saw that louie simmons had released a  page book detailing his life and the story of westside barbell and that it was on sale i legit just pulled out a credit card and paid whatever it cost to have  along with that having followed louie for so long i’m very familiar with his particular brand of insanity as it relates to writing and speaking so i was able to look past a lot of things in this book that will most likely be completely unbearable to a new readerall that said let me start with the conclusion if you’re not a fan of westside barbell i’d skip this book  this is pure fan service going into drama behind the scenes stuff crazy stories stats facts and figures  hardcore powerlifting fans and specifically those of westside will get a kick out of it but those that are just fans of lifting in general hoping to “learn from the master” aren’t going to get much for the price point  there is some gold in this regarding training for powerlifting but you gotta mine the hell out of the book to find itthat said i read the whole thing in  days of casual reading  it’s an easy read and i found it pretty enjoyable  because louie is so scatterbrained it actually makes the book well paced because louie will start on a boring subject but out of nowhere tell a story about a guy kidnapping a dog and getting  days in jail before switching back to talking about band tension calculations  it keeps you on your toesbelow are the notes i took as i read the book to give you an idea of what i was thinkingfeeling at the time  enjoy written all on the third person louie’s alter ego talking about louie written in louie’s delightfully insane “steam of consciousness” writingspeaking style  if you’re unfamiliar with it it will be jarring  if you’re familiar with it it will still be jarring but you’ll be used to it holy hell louie does a subtle callout of ironmind early in the writing accuses them of stealing the idea of the “magic circle” and super squats   as a rabid ironmind and westside fanboy i’m vexed in general louie doesn’t go easy on anyone in the book  he’ll praise people for strengths and speak matter of factly about their weaknesses so and so was a bad squatter so and so never did well in the sport and went on to become a ref etc etc  when i went to kaz’s seminar it was very similar  don’t know if this is a generational thing a “being one of the greatest of all time” thing a “i’m too damn old to worry about being nice” thing or just a thing but it’s honestly pretty cool to have no doubt about the thoughts of the author louie’s “the ball or the sword” story gives the reader a solid understanding of why he is the way he is  the quote “louie believes that if a powerlifter doesn’t want to invest his or her life into powerlifting he or she shouldn’t waste their time” is why he uses the methods he uses  it’s also why he’s so into unlimited ply and only cares about the biggest numbers period dot because that is powerlifting  it’s not about who is the best with an asterisk raw under   hour weigh in drug tested etc etc but simply who can put up the most louie’s age shows primarily in the things he thinks are acceptable to write  if you are sensitive to social issues it’s most likely not going to go over well for you  i’m  pages in and have encountered one homophobic slur not said by louie but relayed by him as something one lifter said to another and his advocacy of “lucha underground where men beat the hell out of the hot women it’s twice the fun” i’m old enough that i “get” his generation and after reading dick marcinko’s “rogue warrior” i doubt anything an author writes can be offensive to me at this point but it may be jarring to other readers “but louie in  would not read any scientific studies from an american author” man can i dig that  paul kelso was speaking illy of the state of exercise science in the  in “powerlifitng basics texas style” as well   “louie first found the importance of the dynamic method most lifters divided training days from heavy to light but strength is measured in velocities not heavy or light instead it is measured by fast intermediate or slow” i feel real stupid for having not thought of it like that before  and part of that is most likely because i’m not a speedy lifter to begin with   louie is unapologetic in how much he despises how us weightlifters are being trained these days  the topic comes up a lot in the book  i imagine it’s a result of him coming from a weightlifting background we never forget our first love  i am so vocally against powerlifting these days and it’s because that’s where i started and it’s rough for me to see the state it’s in right now  of course i’ve also said that we do so poorly in weightlifting that we may as well give louie the reigns and see what happens but i am a fan of chaos louie misspells the names of a lot of lifters in the book  just ran across “glen pendley” and i know i’ve seen more throughout the book “but that the real key was the special single joint exercises” people don’t get this about westside  they think it’s just de and me but that’s only  of the training  eighty percent is repetition effort  that is where the magic happens “producing the rule book and training qualified referees were the key focus of the ipf louie did not agree that an ipf qualified referee status could be achieved in two months of studying a rule book when it took three to five years to be an elite level lifter” love it “to this day louie believes that if an athlete is subject to being tested then everyone connected to the federation should be checked including refs spotters officials meet directors and the guy who collects the door money” also love it “also the ipf had drug testing and lots of people were opposed to having their civil rights invaded” as a political science guy this stuff always bugs me  your civil rights cannot be violated by a private organization only the government can violate your rights   there’s a whole section on federation drama if you’re into that  oh powerlifting “it is hard for louie to understand why powerlifters bad mouth each other instead of uniting together” ok that is a comical lack of self awareness given how the book has gone so far nice to see louie write positively on chuck v  their relationship was strained for a while but seems to be in a good place  and really anything written about chuck is awesome  he’s a goddamn sasquatch in all ways because along with being huge and scary there’s so little out there about him because he doesn’t talk i’m at a part in the book where louie talks about a buddy of his throwing his food on the floor at a restaurant and assaulting the cooks because they put onions in his food  this is one of many stories of downright psychopathy  i can’t tell if louie attracts these kinds of people or if there are just more of these folks out there than i realize tons of stories start with “so and so knew a  year old kid that was really strong and he started lifting at westside and etc etc”  i find it a little off putting how so many of these adult men are just hanging out with these teenage boys  and maybe it just shows how uninvolved i am with my local community but it just feels weird reading it so much “ryan cannelie” for ryan kennelly  ok this book was clearly never edited or proofread  i feel like someone may have tried to help louie at the start of the book and then eventually gave up because around page  or so louie’s rambling style of writing really starts to take off  again if you’re familiar with it it’s not bad but if this is your first exposure to how louie presents ideas you’re in for a ride all criticism aside so far i’m  pages in and all i can think is “this is what ‘westside vs the world’ should have been” “a bodybuilder is at his or her weakest and smallest at contest time in contrast however a powerlifter is at his or her strongest and biggest at contest time” that’s honestly a pretty interesting revelation  something to be said about the razor’s edge of healthperformance a powerlifter is on for a meet peak though   “sue came to westside overweight she wanted to powerlift to get into shape most of the time this does not work” i hope people are taking goddamn notes here  i can’t tell you how many times i’ve seen a  start lifting to “get in shape” and then put on a bunch more bodyweight because they’re “naturally talented” at heavy lifting  no dude you have mass and mass moves mass  you started exercising to get healthy get healthy then put on mass “also normal people can only give you normal results” ding ding ding  people are in such a rush to normalize things but that’s the whole point you gotta be and do things differently to achieve different results “he thought it would take a weight gain to do it so louie pushed up the volume and added more calories” straight from the master’s mouth folks  quit trying to bulk on starting strength up the volume up the calories the “nightrider” section is brutal  just a long list of callouts by louie on former westsiders don’t skim the book because louie’s crazy mind throws things in at random spots  the section on chuck v under world record squatters suddenly turns into a seminar on how bands work louie throws some shade at elitefts clarifying that they are separate businesses  it’s gotta be tough to be louie’s friend i am sure louie writes that he will never watch “westside vs the world”  good call louie it was heartwarming to see how positively louie speaks of jim wendler   page  and now the homophobic slur is coming directly from louie  it’s a quote from the  and i get times were different but still it just takes a book that reads like a kindly old man retelling stories from the past and puts a lot of ugliness in it in short order louie refers to dave hoff as the strongest geared lifter of all time which is honestly a shock for louie  i’m used to him not differentiating between gear and raw just referring to lifters as lifters  wonder if he’s finally gotten sick enough of the politics to feel the need to clarify at this point some of these stories about westside personalities are just painful to get through   helpful reminder that being a good lifter doesn’t mean being a good person  often it can even be necessary to not be one to be the other  this is a selfish hobby i remember in  when i wanted to “do westside barbell training” and the common question was “can i still do it if i don’t have a ghrreverse hyper” and guys like tate and wendler would say you don’t need that stuff and would offer up old school movements like ghrs and rdls and back extensions  but when you read this book you realize just how important all the crazy crap louie developed is for the success of westside  and yeah westside may have started with just the basics but it’s clearly evolved and the idea that you can follow the program without all the specialty equipment is really getting silly now   of the training is mede and the rest is all super specialized bodybuilder work “for some odd reason lots of louie’s friends go to jail” at least louie is aware this is weird “the curse” is an awesome section of the book that describes why louie will set out to help anyone in the world of lifting  very touching so far the last half of the book is basically louie listing names of people and lifts that they didhow those lifts improved while training at westside  this is pretty typical louie simmons stuff  his articles are all like this too  what’s crazy is louie will screw up the spelling of the name of someone he’s known for  years but will know down to the pound how much that person squatted at a meet in  louie advises a rubgy coach to have his players wrestle in the off season to cut down in season injuries  goddamn do i love that suggestionsolution   i’m on page  of  and the book is just running completely off the rails  any semblance of organization is gone and it’s just louie finding jumping off points to rant about people and things  which isn’t to say that it’s not entertaining but again for those that prefer structure you won’t find it here ok now the homophobic slur isn’t a quote from the  or a quote from someone else  come on louie there’s a story about a lifter not knowing what order a powerlifting meet runs in as far as order of lifts and then going on to set a pro total  there’s a lesson there about how being super academic about your sport probably doesn’t matter as much as simply being strong so many of louie’s stories about lifters end with “they died much too young”  probably something to take away from that last  pages of the book are an excellent example of the need for competition in powerlifting in order to get stronger  it can’t just be going against a spreadsheet  competing against a real human drives us to get stronger  also at the very end it says louie banned all the members of the night crew of westside for life which included dave hoff  man i can’t keep up with the drama,powerlifting
those that have a pair of either of the briefs how do u like them how long do they last sizing troubles have u used them under canvas thanks guys i’m trying to decide between the two and would love some expertise,powerlifting
the term raw gets used a bit loosely in my opinion if you cant brace enough to squat a certain weight you have no business squatting it i think the reason some people get more out of a belt than other is simply the lack of bracing strength  wraps for bench same deal mummying up the wrists almost takes them out of the equation to some extent i get that people want to see higher and higher numbers but i feel like the records get lost as equipment gets better i for one would love to see a powerlifting meet where only chalk and shoes were allowed i guess you could argue completely raw to be bare feet and no chalk but for the purpose of this discussion lets say those are allowed   powerlifting has different equipment levels as it is so why not completely rawthoughts,powerlifting

 so im currently dealing with some tendinitis in my right quad i have  knee issues from old sports injuries so im used to taking time off  periodically but im wondering if there would be any benefit to doing  lighter squats as long as theres no pain currently my max is a little  over  and id be doing like  tops at the most with higher reps is  it possible to make progress in terms of size and strength or should i  just shut it down completely until i can get back to lifting heavy,powerlifting
not sure if i’m allowed to post a question about a deadlift problem i’m having anyway when i’ve been deadlifting i get the later reps of my set and the first thing to stop me from getting the next rep is actually my left hand my grip strength is holding me back more than my glutes or hamstrings also when my reps are finished the joints in my fingers are usually in pain which i’m not sure if it’s normal if my left hand wasn’t giving out it feels like i could get a solid  more reps in so i’m wondering what i can do to fix this improve my grip also i’ve been lifting for around  years but only been powerlifting focused doing a  for about  months or so which has made me a lot stronger quickly,powerlifting
i am typically a raw person but starting early next year i want to try switching it up by getting a pair of briefs to change up training i don’t plan on competing equipped nor plan on buying a full suit but i just want to find a good pair of briefs to change up my blocks for shits and gigs i’ve been looking into the inzer predators thoughts on those or other preferred briefs based on your guys experience,powerlifting
bw  finished a   a month ago had a week break due to things happening and then was feeling really weak on the day so only went for  i failed on the  rep on the  set with  minute breaksi got sick after this and was out for another week and started back up again at the start of the week with a  working weight this time using  minute rests i failed on the  rep of the  setmy shoulderblades are back and i keep my elbows at about a  degree angle and im not sure why im getting this weak has anyone experienced anything similar my other lifts are of course down as well but dont feel this weak,powerlifting
hey all im  and   ive been working out for a couple of years on and off but have started focusing on a powerlifting regime and just finished my first program tonightmy question revolves around weight belts i just hit a pr on squat today of   and havent used a weight belt during this program at all i feel as though now my lifts are starting to rise i need to incorporate some extra safety measures into my lifts is now the right time to start using a weight belt,powerlifting
im very new to powerlifting i started my wendler  about a month ago currently at  my stats are  and im just wondering if not using a belt is dangerous when i get to heavier weights my current goal is to get  entirely raw using  and keep it raw until i reach my genetic limit as of the moment i dont feel any imbalance while doing my lifts without any equipmentbelt so i dont think i need any but what about when i get to heavier weights ive seen people deadliftsquat  plates with a belt ive also seen people do  or  plates rawim just wondering if its safe to lift heavy without a belt i heard people get hernias and stuff like that and on the other hand i heard using a belt is bad for your core while deadlifting or squatting  thanks in advance,powerlifting
i was just spectating someone i know in the marines who powerlifts competitively as she was squatting and locking her knees everytime i was confused and concerned at this bc i was pretty sure locking your knees during an extensive motion was known to be dangerous especially if youre an athlete seems like common knowledge she just told me that it is apparently required to lock your knees on squats or they do not count i do not know how powerlifting competitions are structured but that sounds taboo to meknee injuries caused by stress on the joints and ligaments are among the most common serious injuries in most athletes whether youre lifting playing football or basketball or whatever virtually any sport and if not an immediate injury youll face discomfort overtime as seen in most retired athletesa common red flag for virtually anyone with access to a gym or a squat bar being a requirement at the competitive level seems highly irresponsible and above all outdated is this actually a requirment in powerlifting and for fucks sake why,powerlifting
my  bench press has been stalling for the past few sessions which might not  sound very odd at first but my bench has essentially stayed the same  for the past few months only after doing dumbbell bench for a while  after returning to training after the covid lockdown getting a bit  stronger there and stalling aswell was i finally able to go from    to   on the barbell bench pressso  now ive been lifting  for the past few session training  sets  very close to failure each time i dont really count rpe but around rpe   for all sets but havent been able to even increase my total  amount of reps by  training   training      training   it feels more like i am  getting a tiny bit weaker each session instead of getting stronger the  weight feeling a bit heavier each time especially after the first seti  am eating at a surplus of around  calories sleeping  hours  each night eating  proteinbodyweight and training  times a week  full body with my chest training consisting of  sets of  reps on the  barbell bench pressme stalling  on the bench press is just an example i am stalling on other lifts  aswell on others i am progressing for example the squat where i am  adding  every session  times a week but i feel like that is only  the case because my squat is really weak and i am actually stronger than  i thought was aiming for  and was able to complete the last set  with  repscorrect me if i am  wrong but wouldnt the only possible reason for me not getting stronger  almost getting weaker be a lack of recoveryadaption to the training i  am doing it isnt really possible for me to just try harder when i  am already working so close to failure sure i could be feeling off  during one of those workouts but i literally havent gotten one bit  stronger after  sessions and my weight on the bench press is still in  the beginner range i also dont feel like adding in even more sets  would helpmost full body  beginner routines ive seen prescribe  or  of bench press every  other session so  times a week i went with  because a few  more reps feel easier on my joints and even after doing  sets i dont  feel sore at all the next day doing bench  times a week because i  currently cant ohpcorrect me if  im wrong but to me the most logical thing seems like removing one set  so  working not as close to failure benching less frequently or  simply eating more to boost recovery if i want to continue getting  strongeri wont be able to train  with heavy weights for the next month anyway since my country is  getting another lockdown but i will try improving my recovery once i get  back to the gym to see if i can get stronger that waywhat  do you think could be the issue do you agree with my thought process  what else could cause me to get stronger if not a lack of recovery,powerlifting
hello alli am a student who started powerlifting fairly recently  months and am ow experiencing the gyms closing down again due to covid  i am the proud possessor of   dumbells and a training mat but i was wondering what would be the best way to try and maintain as much of my strength during this for now unknown time period i would assume that strength training is impossible using low weight but surely there must be ways to preserve as much as possible i myself was thinking to go and do high volume bodyweight and try to make the exercises as hard as possible using variations but would love to hear more experienced peoples opinionnote am on mobile sorry for layoutnote first time posting sorey if i violated any rules please point them out so i can adjusti thank thee all,powerlifting

 hi everyoneim relatively new when it comes to posting so apologies if i mess up somewherebackgroundwhen i started i had never competed i was  years old with an sbd of  kg full disclaimer the  was extremely dodgy in depth the bench was touch and go and the deadlift was on a deadlift bar with bumpers straps and done while standing about  inches off the ground prior to starting coaching i had not deadlifted in over a year i got to this stage by following cookie cutter programs like smolov over and over again and as expected had started developing  contacti was lifting at the gym following the hepburn method and got to talking to kian on a friendly basis at the time i was doing  kilos for  sets of  and while i would hit depth i would fold over a lot this made sense in retrospect as  was my  rep max for squats but when youre stupid you just hammer away without thinking kian eventually got to talking about competing and if i had ever considered it i said no i didnt really have time university and i was also a broke college kid kian was working under this training group called jps australia and offered to help me out i did a little research found out that he had a few strong guys training with him and everyone had good things to say i took the plungetrainingthe first thing kian did was spend a few weeks really cleaning up my form i want to stress here that while i was paying a discounted rate for online coaching kian would often offer to come down to the gym at the same time as me and train me just because thats the sort of bloke he is he taught me how to perform accessories how to program them and how to not look like an ape in the gym  months in my squat deadlift and bench form was orders of magnitude better i had developed tendinopathy prior to coaching with kian smolov lol and kian helped me rehab that and taught me how to perform prehab i dont want to go into the specifics of programming too much out of respect for kian but it was updated weekly and involved a good mix of specific movements as well as accessories with periodization and minute adjustments made even throughout the week based on what i told him after workouts he also provided a nutrition plan which i followed pretty closelycoaching relationshipover the year training with kian we developed a friendship i can say that as a coach he is extremely responsive respectful and competent he was extremely motivational and i would still be coaching under him today if the circumstances of this year had not occurred i was meant to compete in the nationals in the junior categories in australia which is obviously cancelled i qualified in a small competition and as it is my last year as a junior i have no interest in competing in the open category at the moment as i am entering my field as a doctor soonsquat resultsi had serious hip pain and knee pain going into programming at the end of our coaching i was unpeaked trained for about  weeks and hit  kilos for  repetitions on the squat it felt easy light and i am absent of any nagging pain this was done while not peakedbench resultsbench shot up but the first few months were spent rehabbing my shoulder did not try to hit a pr but went from a  repetition max of  kilos to a  repetition maximum of  kilosdeadlift resultsi had not deadlifted in over a year and honestly had never actually performed a deadlift with good form ever kian taught me from scratch and i went on to hit a  kilogram deadlift for  repetitionsfinal thoughtsi made a lot of progress with kian and my only real regret is that i was unable to go to the junior nats with him all my repetition prs were hit after training with him with me just trying to gauge where i was overall highly recommend him apologies for not having videos of my lifts up im not sure how to do thatif youre interested or have any questions please feel free to contact me,powerlifting

so today i tried to max out for the first time in squats and deadlifts but when i hit  on the deadlift as i stood up after putting the weight down i had quite a bit of a head rush and had to hold on to something it only lasted like  seconds so i stopped going up with the weight since i was lifting alone  is it normal or should i be concerned,powerlifting

just like the title says what are the oddly specific things you have to do during your set up otherwise it’ll throw off your whole lift for example in my deadlift set up i rub my index finger on the edge of the knurling three times before doing my hook grip and then i have to straighten my knees and then hit my shins against the bar three times before i pull,powerlifting

allthis is merely my two cents about  bbb and what i found to be the pro’s and cons of the program i ran it for  weeks and used weights at  of  during covid i did  just to do something and hadn’t done any serious lifting since nov  before i severely injured my  july   rmbench     weight  october   rmbest set during the programbench  rpe   rpe   rpe   rpe  weight  i loved the secondary volume i split up lifts where on bench days i’d do my    ohp as the third movement should be second but i will touch on this later each week i would do the    the first two weeks i noticed on set  i would stall out on rep  or  i would wait ten seconds and crank out the remaining reps i believe this was more of a mental hurdle than physical another pro would be workout time including warming up i would be out in an hour and  minutes i did appreciate thiscons not enough back volume the recommended back volume were a  of pullups twice a week with all the pressing i also added an optional hypertrophy day for upper body i believe that there should have been more back work by  or threefold the program is also redundant and can feel boring doing the same workout over and over i didn’t feel this way until the last two weeks so perhaps this is just me adjustments i added additional hypertrophy backwork i also did this between movement one and two of upper body days to give those muscles a break i either added pendley rows or weighted pullups for a  at rpe  then a  at rpe  and supersetted with some type of ab movement the first three weeks i did not do this but for month  and  i did and felt a noticeable improvement i did not add any additional volume for lower body days as i play soccer  times a week and did not want to overdo anything lastly for the additional hypertrophy days i would focus on arms since those were the days my wife would come with mei regret nothing diet i made sure to hit about  of protein drink a gallon a day and plenty of veggies i know results would be better if i were more focused but i enjoy food and trying new restaurantsanother note a big factor i found was getting new music for each month when the music would stall i began to stall overall i thoroughly enjoyed the program i know my numbers aren’t the best and i would consider myself an intermediate in the loosest of terms but this was a great program to build a solid base moving forward i began nsuns again today after giving myself a week off any critiques would be appreciated on either program happy lifting brothers and sisters,powerlifting
hii have been trying to do some research on the pros and cons of narrow vs wide squats both on reddit and with various studies as with many things these days all i have found so many conflicting studies i used to hate squats but love deadlifts and so i would avoid them at all costs this produced a drastic difference between my squat and deadlift to where i have been deadlifting twice my squat i have since started squatting really narrow and i find i can go a lot deeper and i really enjoy them before i felt my squat was more of a back exercise then anything because i was leaning over so much the really narrow squat allows me to have an upright position even when going atg my question is will i have any muscle imbalances with narrow squat because it seems most people do wide squats should i try to work on my flexibility to do wide squats or just continue with the narrow what is causing this difference between the two,powerlifting
the modification is basically halving the sets on each day in every week i rounded the number up when i divided an odd number of sets i used  of my prs both times i had done smolov jr for bench before so i will compare this version of mine with it pr before smolov jr  paused  after smolov jr  paused  before modified smolov jr   paused fail at top due to weaknesspr after modified smolov jr  pausedi was and still  years old when i collected the datasimilarities same arithmetic strength increase  no muscle sorenessmissed reps in last  workouts but still completed the total amount of reps with extra setsi had tight pecs both timesdifferenceswith the original version i had elbow pain in  week i did not have that with my version i was eating a lot  when i did the original version while doing my version i ate whenever i was hungry less calories and protein as i dont have a big appetiteless geometric strength increase  with original  with the modified but keep in mind that weight increments were also proportional as the amount of kilos added each week did not change with the starting  rep maxconclusionsmolov jr has junk volume for some lifters like me stimulus that is over the least effective amount of volume required to create adaptationsthis might not be the case for everyone as everyone needs different amount of stimulus for the same response,powerlifting

hi  years ago i started getting in shape again through my girlfriend bringing me to a crossfit class i’ve since gotten to know powerlifting and strongman as a sport and i’ve switched over my training to those sports since they suited me a bit betteri’ve been following other people’s programs with good succes so far but lately i wanted to try my hand at programming my own stuffi’ve got a m’n idea on how progressive overload works but i would really like to get a more educated view on strength training in generalare there any good sources out there where one could learn good coachingtraining plan development the goal is not to coach people at the moment might follow later if i’m feeling confident enough but to apply correct training principles to my own training and to continue my progressit’s an unusual question here i guess but i feel that people online just repeat what they hear from others without questioning why some things work and others don’t i’d like to learn to understand these concepts better through thisthanks in advance for any advice,powerlifting

because of the mess that is uspa east right now i ended up competing at an unsanctioned meet to see how my lifts were progressingsquat  attempt  good lift  went well no major  attempt  good lift  also went well felt relatively easy for a  attempt especially since ive only ever gone above  a handful of  attempt  no lift  felt like the strength was there but the loaders messed up my rack height and bar weight which resulted in my standing in wraps waiting to lift for  minutes no complaints ill hit it next  attempt  good lift  felt a bit harder than  attempt  no lift  hand off was good my back wasnt as tight as it should have been which resulted in me losing tension on the way  attempt  no lift  exact same thing compounded with the fatigue of trying it a   attempt  good lift this was easier than it should have been probably could have opened at  but hindsight is  attempt  good lift felt about as easy as the opener which made me decide to take a higher jump than planned for the   attempt  good lift this was probably my favorite rep of all time i couldnt hear or see anything on the way up but it honestly felt like i could have pulled  poundsoverallim happy with my performance as of today ive added  to my total within the last  months and i know ive got more to do if this had been a uspa sanctioned meet i would have set  state records and  world records junioropen deadlift and junior totalany feedbackcriticism is appreciated,powerlifting

about  yo ’    lbs squat  bench  deadlift overall a good introductory program into powerlifting definitely will work for early intermediated don’t know about advanced liftersbackgroundplayed baseball throughout high school and currently play at the college level started lifting around junior year but not super consistently going into freshman year of college was more consistent was running the rfitness ppl routine definitely got stronger but still didn’t really know what i was doing during the spring of freshman year didn’t really workout because of baseball season then once the season ended began with  ran that up until corona virus this year was super consistent  i don’t think i missed a training day aside from a week long vacation and made good progress then had to do mainly dumbbell work to maintain until i got all my home gym gear ran a lp program until my numbers were back up to where they were before shutdown then started candito’s program so this was the first time running a powerlifting so had pretty high expectationsmaxes befores       reviewcandito uses a combination of dup and block periodization the first  weeks are higher volume more hypertrophy focused training and the last  are higher intensity overall i really liked the way he broke up the training and i never really got bored or burnt out i’m just going to go briefly over how i felt each week of training wasweek  this wee was pretty easy overall but it was a productive week for getting introduced to higher frequency benching and just building up overall work capacityweek  this week was really focused on squats and pushing the reps i really pushed the reps on the second squat session so i could get the  sets of  i think this really helped overall with working out kinks with form my bench was also feeling pretty strong weight that i normally was struggling with was feeling easier i think that was mostly due to form i was using leg drive way betterweek  this week was like a mini deload no optional accessories i did throw in some curls cause they wouldn’t effect recovery and i want to have big arms but this was a good transition to the higher intensity weeks as we worked up to some higher weight for the first timeweek  week as really good hit some weights that i hadn’t before or in a long time my upper back spasmed the night before my heavy deadlift and squats but didn’t really effect me too much bench felt really strong hit  for  relatively easilyweek  this was the last formal training week and i decided to just use the numbers i hit here as i didn’t really want to actually test my  squats i hit  which i hadn’t done in a long time and it was pretty easy probably rpe  first to reps were good last  my hips shot back a little but overall i was happy with itfor bench i got  i hadn’t touched this weight before and was really happy with it i could have been better on the bottom half of the lift but again overall it was greatthen for deadlift i got  at rpe  the video looks like it was easier than it felt but it was definitely hardresultss       thoughtsoverall i was really happy with how the program turned out i think if i did a dedicated  testing my maxes could be higher but i’m still happy with how they turned out after reading a lot of reviews i was a little worried about bench after running i do think that this is one of the better programs to run if you never done dedicated “powerlifting” or strength focused program i will definitely run this program again,powerlifting

i just got an email to uspa lifters that he would be resigning and starting a new fed next year wwwuspcpl  on the one hand we definitely dont need anymore feds in powerlifting but on the other it seems like hes creating something for more casual lifters ie lower membership fees less equipment restrictions offering actual refunds ive only competed at uspa east events with him in the past and like how he runs them and as someone who doesnt care about national qualifications or records ill probably compete there post covid if for no other reason than to save money curious to see what others think though,powerlifting

i saw a post a bit back discussing the status of powerlifting as being more niche than other “weightlifting” sports bodybuilding has the larger than life figures weightlifting has the flashier movements and crossfit has received strong marketing pushes and strongman has a strong entertainment appealwhat can powerlifting do to increase its appeal and popularity do you guys and gals even think they should or should it stay more niche,powerlifting

i think we can all agree that whilst powerlifting has grown hugely in popularity in the last few years it’s still somewhat a niche interestsocial media has been huge for the sport and is probably the best place to keep up with the lifts and lifters you want but where do you go for your news or general overview,powerlifting

hello friends im fairly new to the world of powerlifting and lifting in general i started lifting to loose weight to be fully honest im  and used to weight  kg now after about  year of playing rugby and  months of working out between gym and home i am around  kg dream is to be between  and  whilst still being big enough to look like a bear you know what i mean most of us big boys have been compared to animals at some point or another also im eating a calorie deficit about  per dayalso also my training includes a daily ppl routine where i do cardio for  minutes then focus on pushpulllegs specifically with one additional exercise from the other groups just to keep all muscle group active during the week problem is when i deadlift my pulling strength seems to fail after a few reps and i know its not the weight because when i deadlift with straps i can pull  kg easy however when its just my hands i cant do more than  and thats on a good day so what do i do i suspect its my positioning of body posture and or hand posture but i tried it all and cant seem to work it out maybe its because i am cutting but trying to increase weighted reps at the same time so maybe my muscles cannot get enough nutrients to develop enough to pull that kinda weight on their own,powerlifting
in a deep dive around the internet i came across rickey crain’s website where he lists hundreds of video recordings of old meets he has for sale i have a friend who was a competitor in college so i thought a cool present might be a video of her competing about  years ago she’s mentioned several times she doesn’t have much in the way of pictures and memorabilia from that time in her lifei first emailed him in february of  he said they were “changing their dvd ordering system” so should check back “in a month or so” following that i’d reach out more like every other month and i’d hear various answers about how the particular meet i was asking for wasn’t available or how they were trying to go digital with everything and weren’t ready yetin june he told me they had the meet i wanted cool but there was a problem with the labels and it would take “ days before it is ready” it’s been a year and a half another month or so didn’t bother me he asked for my credit card info and everything over email without mentioning how much it would be and i gave it to himhe charged me  now that’s a lot of money for  dvds but it’s not a lot of money in the grand scheme of the universe and i don’t mind it at all honestly at this point i’m really just more emotionally invested and morbidly curious about seeing it throughwhat irked me a little is that after a year and a half of being in touch and him taking sometimes months to get back to me the money was charged to my card in not exaggerating roughly two minutes and since then well over  days more than enough time to print out some labels i also made clear i didn’t really care about he still says he’s “working on it”just out of curiosity i researched him a bit and it seems like he’s gone through some stuff and i’m not indifferent to that this isn’t a rant or anything just maybe a psa about giving this guy your money wouldn’t be surprised if i never see that dvd,powerlifting

calling a deadlift a pull is imo an extremely dangerous conceptidea in a deadlift movement pattern the only moving parts are the legships they are pushing the ground away in effect the deadlift is simply a leg press but with the weight attached to your arms via your hands the throwing around of the idea of pulling the weight or having deadlifts on pull days is extremely dangerous because you do not trigger the adequate amount of leg drive and abdominal compression this leads to lower back rounding loss of the neutral lumbar curve as well as excessive thoracic rounding as welljust try cuing leg drive instead of pull and the difference will be night and day you will lift less but your back will definitely not give way and you will infinitely decrease the chances of messing up your spinal discs,powerlifting
backstory been deadlifting since jan onoff due to covid when i started i found it difficult to get a neutral lumbar spine at the starting position tight hamstrings i fixed this by stretching and practicing the movement patternnowadays im able to get into the correct starting position ie following starting strengths  step setup guide but at  or more reps i feel as though im unable to flatten my lumbar spine during setup are there any exercises i could do to fix this thanks,powerlifting

tldr at the bottomi havent worked out in a year the last  months were because of covid closing gyms the  months before that because nursing school ate up every second i had to spareim a    bmi  body fat percentage  used to weightlift and power lift quite a bit i rock climbed a ton dabbled in crossfit until i realized my local instructors had no clue what they were doing and did some cycling and running powerlifting has always been my favorite method of working out i love deadlifts i work out primarily for stress release nothing does that better than moving big shit i also have loose kneecaps and blasting my quads helps to prevent me from dislocating anything i also like having useful muscle that allows me to go about my day much more easily than otherwise im not looking to compete at least not right now i just want to move big shit stress release and gain useful muscle i also sleep better if i am working out which is really great im also not looking to lose weight i eat pretty well higher protein lowerish carb and i know how fuel myself for workoutsim moving into my dorm at school in  days and im trying to find a good simple straightforward workout program that i can bust out in  minutes to an hour ive looked at doing a  routine because it seems very straightforward and would allow me time in the beginning to get my form back on point all the squats are scaring me but i also know that they will help me out a lot i know my body responds well to the training typeload increases that are used in a  also know that i have a really hard time activating my glutes im wondering if adding a  of barbell hip thrusts in the b workout squat ohp deadlift at least for the first couple of weeks would help with that ive always had to supplement even when i was working out a lot i just dont want to blow out my lower back because my glutes arent able to help with the other lifts enough and then damage something as the weight increases im going to take this slow since i know most of my muscle mass is gone and it will be hard to build it back up againi also can only work out in mornings and im wondering if a  would tire me out for the day i love working out in the mornings  usually im just curious if anyone has had trouble with feeling exhausted for the rest of the day tldr getting back to lifting looking at trying a  to build back to the strength i had maybe adding a  of barbell hip thrusts for a couple weeks to support my glutes which dont like to activate advice on that and any other things i should know about a  before i get started,powerlifting
apologies if this is against the rules why am i weak af in the gym with almost all lifts ive been going to the gym for about  years now my totals are around  bench  squat and i dont deadlift but id imagine its around  obviously theyre not too bad but i play rugby at a fairly high level and compared to even some of the smaller players on my team those numbers are pretty awful im  and  and outside of the gym im quite strong ie in scrums rucks mauls etc but in the weightroon i just cant get my numbers up would it be because of my long limbs making a mechanical disadvantage or perhaps is it down to me having poor form again apologies if this breaks rules but if love to hear if anyone has any advice because its really bothering me,powerlifting
i have recently been getting my max numbers on compound movements up quite a bit and was wondering if there was a way to train for increasing the amount of weight i can move rather than just size plus the sport of power lifting has always interested me,powerlifting
hey guys   ive been powerlifting for a fair amount of time and have gotten to some heavy lifts recently ive been having an issue that i never had before and it happened twice during my bench press first was my shoulder tightened up and got sore so i had to take weeks off now my chest tendon on the left side did the same thing it suddenly tightened up as i was coming down from the eccentric and its been slightly painful more so sore for a few days and i know it will go away after some good rest   the main question here is i realise i cant just keep increasing weights this way so how do i condition my muscles to be able to withstand these heavier weights,powerlifting

hi all im fairly new to powerlifting and really enjoying my training i feel im making good progress with deadlift and bench but squats seem to be the bane of my existence i squat high bar due to a back injury in february and progress is insanely slow i feel like im going to die with every rep and find its extremely hard not in a satisfying way that the other lifts are i also get disproportionately worse doms in my quads than anywhere else in my body i have an online coach and have had a  session with a respected coach locally and both said my form was good so is there anyone else out there who struggles with these how do i convince my head that i wont die i see ladies on instagram squatting  like its nothing while i feel  is going to crush me stats for infofemale aged     all,powerlifting
ive been doing a lot of volume with moderate loads for months now and all sets have gotten stronger and some singles got better also would you ever just switch to westside and get rid of the volume to peak your strengthi accidentally did something like this once but i think the contrast wasnt big enough i felt like all the capacity built over a year with kind of linear periodization was turned into a explosive max strength in a couple of months but my progress in squat at least stopped and slowed in other lifts i think due to lower volume for too longnow that ive built some new capacity and learned a lot of good form would you just switch and start doing me and de for a few months and then test  for reading i know this sounds like cutting corners and it surely is just that i think it could work even though its not optimal but it might be close enough for a intermediate lifter i am  and my gym total is ,powerlifting
i wrote this to clarify my own priorities but i hope other people might find it useful too the criteria on these lists are somewhere on the spectrum of principles methodologies and rules to live by and theyre all ways to become the best powerlifter that your genetics will allow if you follow each one i think you would be doing the absolute most to ensure your successthe necessary category is for methodologies that i think are critical for improvement and if even one is discarded excepting supplements because their effect is fairly negligible and rehab if you dont have any injuries youre shooting yourself in the foot the ideal category includes methods that will become more and more important as your gains slow down eventually becoming necessary as well necessary methodologies for programming use a simple wellregarded program that’s easy to follow technique use technique that’s comfortable for you while meeting competition form body maintenance mobilityrehab if you have any difficulty performing a movement avoid it or find a rehabilitative exercise that will alleviate your difficulty dont do any movement just because you feel like you should cortisol management sleep as much as possible body composition if you need to cut then cut and if you need to bulk bulk if you need to stay the same do that nutrition eat your required amount of protein and eat an amount of food commensurate with your body composition goals supplementation use proven supplements creatine caffeine etc ideal methodologies for programming consider hiring a coach use micro meso and macrocycles with the appropriate balances of exercise choice volume intensity and frequency within the confines of your recovery abilities and personal schedule technique learn to use your leverages as perfectly as your body and the rules will allow  body maintenance mobilityrehab identify potential problem areas in your joints musculature or range of motion and address them to preclude issues utilize advanced recovery methods such as sports massage theragun massage sports physiotherapist physical therapy contrast bathing and cryotherapy cortisol management reduce internal stressors with your preferred methods ie positive selftalk visualization therapy and other mental health strategies similarly with external stressors reduce or eliminate unnecessary obligations that sap your time or energy and limit interaction with people who have ambivalent or negative attitudes about your journey keep a supportive circle around you body composition identify your most appropriate weight class become as muscular as possible at or slightly above the cutoff for your weight class nutrition consider hiring a coach eat the requisite ratio of carbs and fats in line with your performance and body composition goals eat your meals with optimal timing eat highquality foods supplementation test your blood to identify and correct micronutrient deficiencies experiment with other supplements that may have beneficial properties use what works discontinue what doesn’ti think its a neat idea to rank principles by importance i see it all the time when talking about nutrition caloriesgtmacronutrientsgtmicronutrientsgtmeal timinggtsupplementation but not about everything involved in a powerlifting success story id love to see what a more experienced lifter would have on their list so please share if youre willing thanks for reading,powerlifting

just got my new titan multiangled bar in took  months fuck corona and decided to swap wide grip incline presses with the widest neutral grip on the bar for volume today triceps annihilated shoulders feel amazing and surprisingly the chest contraction was intense far more than my usual pressing even without focusing on mmc it was  wondering who here uses this during the off season and then swaps to a straight bar for specificity work during a peaking block how’s the carryover also do you use any other alternative equipment to train during off season i use an ssb trap bar and probably from now on the multi grip bar just wondering what everyone’s favorite tool is to push their totals up while reducing a bit of risk factor associated with pl,powerlifting
 hey everyone im new to powerlifting just transferred from calisthenics a month ago and i have a few questions about my programming and progressyesterday i tried deadlift for the first time and got  x    bw my goal is that in the next year i get it to  x  while maintaining my bodyweight my plan is to get the weight up to  in the next  months and increase the reps to  so ill reduce risk of injury after adding weighti plan on keep adding weights once i get my pr to  reps at the same time i was wondering whether i should deadlift on back day or leg day i currently deadlift after squats i just want to reduce the risk of injury and add weights safely while maintaining body weight any diet recommendations since i heard with powerlifting in general i shouldnt be on the caloric deficit thanks,powerlifting
im a college student with a parttime job beside school and due to work im considering changing my gymtimes from late afternoon  early evening to the very morning you can see lot of early birds in the gym who advocates a morning gym over an evening one it definitely wakes you up have good health benefits etc what about heavy lifting ive read articles eg in terms of burning energy powerlifting sessions are more effective in the late afternoon since youve already eaten  main meals plus  additional high calory snacks therefore you have more energy compared to a person who just woke up had a small breakfast then hit the gym for the same high volume powerlifting session however i want to find people who would debate this statementive always loved a good morning exercise whether its a morning run swimming or shooting some balls on the nearest basketball court but a high intense lifting session  times a week in the morning could be a whole another story any thoughts experiences with lifting in the morning,powerlifting
hi  years into training first started squatting low bar got up to around  lbs for an estimated max  lbs x   months ago i completely switched to high bar with the intent to make my quads humongous at first i was way weaker probably a  max but within  months i caught up to my low bar max and fast forward to today i maxed out at  lbs now i’m debating the idea of switching back to low bar as pretty much every powerlifter i see squats low bar in terms of preference i have no idea because the transition from lbgthb was pretty smoothvery vague and blurry overall but what would you guys recommend,powerlifting
i bench  squat  probably around  now just havent maxed in a while and deadlift  i dont think its my leverages as im only  ive failed  on the deadlift  times now and i still struggle with repping  on the squat is there a reason why my bench is comparatively so much better than my other  lifts,powerlifting
for context i tried powerlifting between oct   got mentally burnt out and haven’t done any consistent lifts since then i’m thinking about getting back into it i am less bulky than a year ago thanks to cardio but i still retained a lot of strength and muscle mass and i did some paused dls at  in june that felt good for someone who wasn’t lifting consistently my university is online this semester and my overprotective mom doesn’t want me to get a gym membership because of the risk of covid from shared gym equipment so i’ll likely be getting more  plates for my basement “gym” setup i can deadlift down there albeit not more than  because of the lack of weights and i can also bench not the best bench but it’ll do but i have no squat rack i have some free weights that i can squat with but what is the best substitute for what i would do for squats there’s no way i can afford or fit a whole rack i don’t think i can do body weight squats with  lbs of plates but i don’t want to only train dl and bench for the next four or maybe more months,powerlifting
i started training at a gym in june  had no idea what i was doing and didnt really stick to a program i just did a bit of everything  in august i had to stop started training some calisthenic style stuff at home built a good foundation from essentially nothing over the next two months i could do a few pushups and a pull up   end of november i returned to the gym this time with the sole aim of building strength i started on the blaha  program saw my bench go from  to  squat from  to  and deadlift go from  to  i had to stop due to covid and lockdowns   i trained calisthenics pretty hardcore from april through to july and now can finally return to the gym my bench and deadlift have actually increased bench  is now  and deadlift  is now  my squat is around    would a beginner program be the best bet for me to get the best gains now ive returned to a gym i have technically been training for  months now just only the last  months have been consistent and planned,powerlifting

hi alli haven’t been lifting much in the past several months however i have plans to get back into training when my uni gym opens back up instead of pl i have picked up roller skating the first thing that i noticed was my knee valgus has reared it’s ugly head in yet another sport it’s been a problem since i first started squatting a few years ago progressed to even caving while conventional deadlifting it’s become awfully discouraging i feel like i have no athleticism whatsoever and that i’m doomed to the land of valgus forever i’m dreading getting back into lifting because of this my history of attempting to find a resolution every warm up session beginning with banded clam shells goblet squats monster walks hip thrusts single leg rdls obv no band specific incorporation of adductor machine heavy hip thrusts widened stance squat variations esp box squats even banded deadlifts basically any movement requiring glutes that i can band i have tried  lowering the weight and training up when the valgus is controlled never got controlled so i just gave up after many stints of continuously going back to an empty barbell for months at a timeno dice i’ve seen hundreds of how to videos articles etc but haven’t seenheard many success stories so has anyone got one to offer i’d love to know what was the key to your success and how long it took ps i’ve never experienced any knee pain i’m just trying to avoid it,powerlifting

im   a climber and i decided to use powerlifting as a means to improve my power to weight ratio twelve days ago i stuggled to pull  for  in my very first session yesterday i wanted to push myself  session so i did some warmup pulls for form and continued to increase weight yesterdays lifts looked something like this rounded from freedom     very  very hard form suffered on   very hardbetween yesterdays session and the previous session  hours rest i saw a  difference in what i would describe as very hard   i plan on lifting and climbing again tomorrow  rest with the target weight being  but i dont know how to optimize my  so that there arent large increments as i try to guess at what the new very hard will begiven that form faltered after the  rep i also dont know if i should shed a few kilos at the top for a more consistent pulling session or rather how much to shed or if i should expect to feel more comfortable pulling that weight and expect another jump of  tldr form and strength are improving rapidly how do i plan my session ahead of time for large beginner incremental increases,powerlifting
right weird question i know however with the lockdown finally coming to an end where i live i will be swapping gyms to my old gym now the question that beckons here is my old gym doesnt ahve proper sized plates so essentially when deadlifting you are pretty much always doing deficit deadlifts do other people face this problem is it bad what are your thoughts,powerlifting
some quick background on myself competitive powerlifter in highschool and college now just as a hobby and current highland games athlete in a class i was also an assistant sampc for two years at the  level prior to going to pt school upon graduation i was a staff pt for a  athletics program i picked up this program because i absolutely love bb medicine and their content however this program in my opinion was a massive swing and a miss all my critiques and criticism are based on how i like to train and the methods that work best for me this is not at all meant to be taken as a broad generalization for all lifterscompetitors weaknesseslots of volume with little to no variation from phase to phase you maintain the exact same setreps scheme for months this drives me crazy and i get bored quickly and lose motivation my favorite program is  with my own little additions you squat every training session which always leaves me completely depleted for deadlifts the big three all have a top single at  and then  back down sets my body just can’t take that heavy workload  you also bench every training session with the same setrep scheme starting heavy ass single with a tons of back down sets which led to  a pec tear i lost  lbs on my deadlift with this program which was the main impetus to quit the program early it seemed like a more random and haphazard version of juggernaut training powerlifting program pros i love the bb medicine guys and gals so i understand that this program may be great for some but was terrible for me,powerlifting

hi guys just looking for some advice from anyone that has any experience with this i’ve been powerlifting for over a year now and i’ve have consistent stomach pain once i started dead lifting over  i use a lifting belt and it definitely exacerbates the issue but i like using it and i also feel safermore comfortable with it as i’ve had some back issues in my pass i work on core strength consistently though to make sure it is keeping up with the rest of my body i’ve recently gotten a more malleable belt which helped a bit but not significantlyi’d describe the pain as just intense painful pressure in my stomach that goes up into my esophagus i hate myself for this description but it’s the best i can think of 😂 no nausea or anything it is only during the lift and does not continue after i’ve recently starting putting my belt on quickly and doing my dead lifts very fast and this has definitely helped quite a biti’ve stopped eating  hours beforehand experimenting which works best and also trying different foods no dairyonly smoothiesplainer food such as oatmeal but nothing has made a difference i also find it difficult to have a successful workout if i’ve eaten more than  hours before the workout as i don’t end up feeling fuelled sorry this is long but it’s been a consistent frustration for me i’ve deadlifted less and cut reps when i do and obviously this makes for way less progress i’ve subbed in more assist work to help but it’s not the same any help or advice would be so appreciated my sensitive baby stomach is really getting on my last nerve,powerlifting
 day split  squat  bench  deadlift  pressshould i do ghr on deadlift day and front squats on squat day or vice versabasically should i do my assistance exercise on the day that matches the muscles used in the main lift or alternatei think of ghr as an assistance for the deadlift and front squat as assistance for the squat but im not sure if i should be alternating them to be hitting those muscles more often,powerlifting
i know this comes off as a vague question but ive heard people talk about powerlifters specifically coaches as knowledgeable vs not knowing what theyre doing sure you have formally educated individuals like dr mike israetel or dr layne norton but what about highlevel athletescoaches like jonnie candito or joseph franzo i could be wrong but im pretty sure neither of them have degrees in exercise sciencekinesiology for all that thats worth as an intermediate powerlifter how can i achieve this obviously competition experience is huge ive only done  meet powerlifting for  year do i just do a lot of research online compete more and over the years accumulate knowledge i guess my ultimate goal is to learn how to coach others and selfprogram similar to what candito does now,powerlifting
so a year ago i tore my pec believed to be muscle belly as an mri showed no tendons torn i still cant bench anywhere near what i was doing bench  is about my limit and i was at  incline at  the other day hurt a bit when i was at  i seen  different orthos and had  mri both said that they couldnt feel the obvious hump and divot on my pec and the one as i said seen no tears through the mri it still bothers me mentally and physically does anyone have advice on what i should do from here,powerlifting
do you think there are points where general strength training and power lifting converge or if power lifting is a good way to just generally train strength for other sports im new to lifting heavy but my friends convinced me that it would help my overall athleticism my friends are training for power lifting specifically however im boxing and feel that im a little slow and weaker for my size and since ive never lifted heavy i figured id give it a shot to build explosiveness and strength,powerlifting
so ive tried a few programs including sl  and nsuns honestly liked them but i got very tired of doing very repetitive medium load and very high volume also im no way an advanced lifter  ’   bench  squat and  dead ive always been a skinny fat body type and ate less than i needed now ive been eating  cals a day and im gaining very decently but i still believe im somewhat thin and i want to maximize the intensity to try and gain that thick bone structure though body dysmorphia or not i love training with very heavy weights  reps and im trying to create a benching and squatting program i think my deadlift still has lots of workout to workout lp left which would resemble the bulgarian method with the high intensity every session but tweaked to fit my athletic leveli was thinking something along the lines of a couple warmup sets to a set of five then a triple then working up to training max with a couple singles     though im coming to reddit because i want to know if someones had any experience with something similar to this any advice or pointers to programs would be absolutely awesome thanks for your timetdlr   skinnyish guy all my life tried basic lp programs but like variation and no super high volume as i want to maximize strength definitely want to try a comp trying to create a basic program for myself similar to the bulgarian style to work with heavy weights every session but am looking for advice as an intermediate lifter,powerlifting
just curious what everyone’s opinion is do you think it’s worthwhile to go higher than  reps should i save higher reps for assistance work,powerlifting

dear powerliftersive been lfting on and off for  years now oly coached for about  years am a bit sick and tired of always haveing little ouchies and people telling me i look like i dont lift jokes aside how would you qualify the the strain on your body in a decently cycled powerlifting program i´ve tried to read a bit about it and it seems that in some programs powerlifting is a lot about daily maximums am thinking of switching my juggernaut ai program to powerlifting because i guess i could very much enjoy that i would probably lift more often even and have more fun without going insane about shit like sequencing the punch out in the snatch just right i also like hatebreed and beer a lot sorry 😘,powerlifting
today i was supposed to hit a  and on the first set could only get  reps it was the same weight as last week and i did all sets completely fine and for some reason this week my body just said no i quit the workout after the second set and only getting  reps deadlift has always been the lift in my training that’s annoyed me at higher rep ranges but considering i hit this same exact weight last week is bothersome any tips of what to do,powerlifting

so that included deadlift bar bench squat rack and plates,powerlifting
when it comes to strength it seems that isometrics induce greater muscle activation and that if you did the isometrics at different key points of the exercise you would ensure that strength is developed through the full range of motion due to isometrics increased strength in the targeted area as well as the surrounding areai can see though how do to the heavy weight the motion itself needs to be practiced as a skill in order to ensure to better condition the body to dealing with an unstable weight,powerlifting
dont care for instagram facebooks a mess so whats left is youtube other than dave tate whos putting out similar stuff worth watching,powerlifting
hi guysi have only been powerlifting training for about  weeks after gyms opened and i decided to follow the candito linear program a friend introduced me to the program and his youtube channel and i loved his content so decided to follow his free programafter weeks into the program the lower body days are starting to be a bit tough since im squatting and deadlifting in the same session and i cant help but feel my deadlifts are suffering a little eg my hips and legs are already quite tired after squats and i have to hit deadlifts straight after conventional deadlifts and high bar squats my cns also feels fried by the end of the workout whereas upper body feels good and i dont feel devastated after the workoutanyone else who runs or has run this program can give me some advice and insight i know i havent been doing this program for long and will stick it out but looking for any help to get strongerthanks,powerlifting
many people have had their training and competition plans significantly interrupted by the  response so now that some are slowly being allowed back into their gyms and able to resume training what are your plans and goals for training and competition coming out of this mess,powerlifting
i’ve been utilizing the deadlift in my workout routine for  years now lately i have been fixing or improving my form because i have bad knees and shoulders so proper form is important as it is for everyonei’ve been using alternate grip every time i keep trying hook grip but i can’t handle the pressure on my thumb at any weight higher than  or so does the discomfort come with all lifters who try to switch to hook grip i would like to switch to a group that is less stressful to the bicep tendon than alternate grip if anyone has advice please leave it i’m opposed to using straps but i haven’t blacklisted straps if that’s the only real option i’ll go for it or can you use over hand grip with long fingers being the base rather than the thumb,powerlifting
ive never had much luck with belts i dont know what happening with my physiologically but every belt ive tried puts a crazy amount of pressure on my gut where the belt meets flesh it doesnt matter how tight or loose it is is there a belt thats wider than normal maybe something resembling a corset im thinking it would spread the pressure out more instead concentrating it in a thin strip i know there are corsets for fitness but the ones ive seen are made of flimsy material and i doubt would handle the pressures put on it during heavy sets,powerlifting
 hey so my main issue is when i sumoor any deadlift at certain weight i have to either use straps or use chalk with alternating grip the issue  i cant use hook grip due to really small hand failed to learn it  i dont normally train with alternating because it worsens my hip imbalance and only do so a month out from  i use normal loop strap and when setting up i like to descend while opening my legs to position and leaning forward to to wrap the strap down several times makes me lose form and theres a huge difference in my form hip and body pivot if i go into it from standing vs from being hunched over the bar after wrapping the  its a cheap bar i got during the pandemic so the knurling is pretty meh compared to an ohio or texas bar i used to useso i was wondering whats some straps that might be easier to setup and faster so i dont lose my form ie i saw some people use straps with metal hooks that i can just hook on or figure  straps seem a bit easier and faster but any input is appreciated,powerlifting
 i  just had my  week post op appointment from a serious surgery where my  appendix burst an abscess formed and i had to have about  of colon  removed due to the infectioni  will be easing back into lifting over the course of several months   previous prs    and focusing on my core strength and  stability before restarting any sort of program however my surgeon  told me that i have to give up lifting heavy completely and no  deadlifts for the rest of my life due to risk of hernia at the incision  sitehas anyone ever returned to  powerlifting specifically deadlifting after a similar abdominal  surgery not looking for medical advice im looking for personal  experiences of those who have come back from this as i am pretty  disheartened to think my dl days are behind me at ,powerlifting

im pretty sure i am not the only one here that at least every once in while suffers from some discomfort from the low bar position especially with heavier loads elbow pain nagging shoulders and what not   i think its a needless irritation what probably can be tackled with a good mobilityflexibility protocol  and thats exactly what i am looking for what kind of protocols have worked for you to get a comfortable low bar position because unfortunately in this case more specific training more low bar squatting doesnt help  if you provide some answers please not only a particular stretch pretty sure i know most of them but also how you implemented them so in other words what has worked for you,powerlifting

 there isnt really a one size fits all for this but im just curious what people think are decent weight to bodyweight ratios for lifts i know lifting is a continual climb and you have to work at it i just want to know when i can say im starting to get okay at the lifts certainly there are a lot of factors that can determine your ability to progress such as past injuriesive mostly just been working the standard bench squat and deadlift as im still early into getting back into lifting obviously you should be able to do at least bodyweight for these lifts but is  good for bench and maybe  for squat i would assume this is a decent way to base performance considering competition is based on weight class sort of a nebulous question but im curious what people think,powerlifting
so i dont have a specific literature reference for this it is more of a question from semiconsistent reading of runninglifting i know in marathon running or any race above  it is common for athletes to spend a period of time building a large aerobic base of miles before getting into race specific training for  weeks i am wondering if there is some possibility of a cross application to powerlifting for the beginnernew intermediate  i currently bench  lbs for a  at  lbs of weight as a   male i have done  for a while on and off for a couple years and consistently for  months of course there is no reason to abandon the program if i am consistently seeing improvement workout to workout or even week to week but this is somewhat of a curiosity question i am planning on maxing in late june would it be beneficial to start moving to    etc in the last month and keep adding  lbs if i cannot complete  each workout i would be increasing the load and only training my body for a  this would probably result in less progress on a long term basis but i am wondering for a one month phase once i have a  i would then return to my aerobic phase analog of lifting and back solve a  calculator to get my  weight i would then do the standard  workout for  months and in the  month redo my   decline down etc get a new  and cycle on for a bit i apologize if this question was unclear or not appropriate for this subreddit i have certainly enjoyed trying to apply my running knowledge to powerlifting and viceversa recently,powerlifting

what would be the best programs to run in order for powerlifting to maximise strength potential and ideally as fast as possible not to waste time  as a brand new intermediate of course i’d love to hear experienced powerlifters or people who have gone through and seen the results on multiple programs thoughts on what to run and in what order my current thoughts were to run the texas method then jim wendler  then sheiko or calagry barbell  week or candito then smolov jr,powerlifting
hi guysi’m running candito’s linear programme and had a question on the control day i presume the primary upper body exercise in my case the row would be paused but the secondary exercise the pull up as well as the shoulder exercise overhead press wouldn’t be paused as they require more repsif anyone can advise me confirming this i’d appreciate it thanks ,powerlifting

 hello everyoneim   previously i was  most of my body fats were in  my belly fat so i made a diet and got down to  as you can see  became an underweight while being so physically weaksince  the quarantine days i started to read and been interested so much into  powerlifting so i bought a barbell dumbell and couple of weights and  started stronglifts  routine my current numbers are as you may have  expected too light my squats are   barbell weight   free  weightsmy question is i want  to get as strong and big as soon as i can in a healthy way from the   session i plateaued so i tried to increase the volume and also  thinking to increase additional exercises to the routine like some  curls isolation exercises and such with the goal to add intensity to  my workoutim looking to add  intensity so that when i increase my food intake it doesnt get stored  as fat and hopefully most go to muscle mass instead im aware that a  portion of the excess calories must be stored as fats im trying to  minimalize as possible the fats since i still have belly fat even being  skinny underweightso any  recommendations on the type of exercises to add to my routine in order  to increase the intensity of the workout and strength and hopefully  help defeating my current plateau statethanks in advance,powerlifting
hi first time poster i believe currently many of us are building a setup at home to continue lifting and i think this post can benefit us all which is why im posting it here i hope its the right placeive been designing multiple ways of lifting platform to find the most noise and vibration lessening one my neighbours living room is next to my garage so its kind of a necessity question starts hereafter watching hafthors  deadlift i was surprised how quiet it was and how little did the weights bounced even though they were iron plates so i investigated a bit and found out they are rogues   high density rubber flooring importing them isnt an option for me but ive found double density i guess thats equivalent   ones would stacking two of them have a similar effect what if i gluescrew them i was thinking of bolting them down to the platform anyways but i guess the strength transfer between the two and therefore the force mitigation would be better if they were glued together what kind of glue should i useanyone has tried this how did it gotldrwould stacking two  highdensity rubber mats achieve the same effect as rogues  highdensity rubber mats for a lifting platform any other tips,powerlifting

in my first competition as a powerlifter i was forced together with the rest of the contenders all experienced and strong physically and mentally than me  to wait more than  hours between each of the lifting exercises in which we competed anyone who watches sports competitions knows that this is more or less a twothreehour event we waited  hours between the bench press and the deadlift  long exhausting hours in which much of the tension of the first entrance has already been removed but we must save more for the second exercise and meanwhile stressed bored irritated tired and hungry –  because we got up early and at least some of us can’t perform well on a full stomach – and then another dry fruits and another energy drink but  hoursfinally  hours later then the announcer announces that we have  minutes to warm up and then the last round of the competition  begins and everyone like a welloiled machine concentrates all energies and boom we did our part and lift the barbellsbecause in training we practiced the long breaks – the official explanation is that you need recovery time between sets – but if you ask me  hours do not contribute to recovery vice versa but on the other hand the long wait causes the body to know at the moment of truth without complex preparation exactly what and how it should be doneeach of the base exercises in powerlifting long before it is a strength exercise is a neural exercise and when the nervous system knows what is expected of it it mobilizes in a fraction of a secondwhen the organization finds out that it is in the middle of a cyber attack every second counts any decision will immediately affect the situation the most fundamental dilemma whether to paralyze server and backup will be simple if the reasons and implications are clear the question of whether to comply with the hacker’s infidel demand would be different if it was considered during a calm routine as opposed to the urgency of making the decision under firebusiness resilience cyber resilience depends entirely on the ability to make good  decisions under fire equifax managers decided to sell shares as soon as the data breach was announced – two hours within the event and the share plunged by more than  the managers are currently under federal investigation the senate is pressuring the new management and the public is suing in small claims court for   each as the american law allows it as a victim of an information leakage the damage is huge and its ramifications are wide and consistentdecision making under fire dictates the business resilience of the organization to cope and recover quickly and efficiently if it is important for you to lead your organization effectively within a cyber attack there are three critical questions that you as ceo must ask yourself what do you know about the threat that could endanger your organization  do you understand what your security manager is talking about if and when you ever talk to him the human factor is responsible for  of cyber attacks – what do you do about it  do you feel confident that ayear ago you heard a lecture about awarenessyou can’t rely on that time when you had an awareness talk awareness is not a campaign that you approve once a year and it’s definitely not a phishing email sent on wednesday because it all worked out that way awareness is a daily routine awareness is a breathing process that changes all the time cus of employees change in and out and moving on the sophistication of attacks will always be upgraded access roads will always be challenged you must lead an active approach that will practice the organization all the time even without feeling challenged you must be interested in the results of these tests to reflect them to members of management to the board of directors who do you call as soon as you discover that you are in the middle of an event do you have a response team that know how to act together and familiar with your business needsit’s possible to perform successfully after long  hours only when you practice the body to do what is accepted from him in real time  maintaining business resilience during a cyber attack is your ability to immediately concentrate all relevant factors – technological legal  financial marketing human resources – and get them to unite in one second and work as a skilled teamlegendary boxer mike tyson has said in the past that everyone has a plan until he gets a punch in the face really everyone haseinat meyron cyber resilience consultant for managers,powerlifting

hey guysim in quarantine and want to make some massive gains i also have a poverty bench so i was thinking hey why dont i do smolov but for bench instead of squat plus my squat is really good  better than my deadlift sometimes i read up on that and learned that smolov is only suggested for the squat since it will lead to elbowshoulder pain and many imbalances instead they recommend smolov jr which is only  weeks  a week of testing which i guess im not as hyped about i want a little bit of a longer program than smolov jr but also something intense and something i will make some nice gains with any suggestions multiple smolov jr blocks just go for the true smolov bench program and see what happens another similar programthanks,powerlifting

hi everyonei come to you to see if you can help me solve a problem ive been struggling with since  year maybe its simple everytime i squat and deadlift i start feeling a type of soreness in my lower backi dont particurarly lift heavy im a little guy and i just lift  kg and im very careful with the tecnhique i really focus on not corving my lower back and keep it thigh and not relaxed but as i keep doing more and more sets the pain keeps increasingat the first set of the squats i practically dont feel nothing the second one i can feel some sensation there but in the third and fourth set the soreness really starts to be noticeablemy main concern is to develop a herniated disc i really care for my health and im very young  years and i dont want to fuck up my back for the rest of my life  years ago the doctors did me a mri and noticed a lumbar protusion because i used to suffer lower back pain when walking for a long period of time which i keep suffering btw the traumathologiat recommended me to just do exercises with the back laying on something advise that i sent to hell since i think thats bullshitin terms of stretching i just do a common stretch at the beginning of the set  min before and i think i should stretch longer but idk i want to hear your opinionsone last thing the pain get worse if i didnt exercise for a long period of time for example if i didnt workout for  month the next time i squat i will feel a much more intense pain on the other hand if ive been exercising for  months straight i will keep feeling the pain but less intense,powerlifting
i believe i’ve strained one of my tricep heads in my left arm and i can’t do any horizontal pushing like bench pressing i even feel pain when i attempt to warmup with only the bari can do things like dips and overhead press although incline bench hurts as well but it has been a few weeks and i’d really like to get back to horizontal pressing movements as soon as i canhas anyone else ever experienced something similar trying to get an idea of healing time and if it’s safe to continue doing pushing movements that don’t hurt and if that will impede my healing,powerlifting

thought i’d start a thread of training tips applicable strictly for masters equipped or rawfor me consistency and staying injury free are the keys to success  i’m lucky because i started late at age  now  and still making lifetime gains whereas a lot of my fellow competitors are on a declinei do lots of foam roller yoga stretches bands etc and of course dynamic warmupalways listen to my body but always try to push a little harder than last week  i’m not much of a program person but mainly focus on the big three not a lot of assistance that’s just mei also do some cardio  want to stay alive  so jogging a few k up to ,powerlifting
so i know how everyone says after a smolov jr cycle for example  once youre done you lose a bit of the gains you made but why is that because they didnt sustain the volume or frequency is it possible to keep up the volumefrequency year round lets say if you luckly dont get injured,powerlifting
my insane i mean intense difficult andor unorthodox something like  on deadlifts,powerlifting
tldr do you think the transformer bar is worth itdiscussion i am going to buy a ssb this week and i was dead set on getting the black widow until i found the kabuki transformer a primary reason why i like the black widow compared to other versions like the titan elite rogue etc is because i like the longer handles i also just like black widow gearhowever i like the transformer better than the black widow because the section of the bar that goes through the shoulder pads is curved so it looks like it fits over the shoulder nicely ive only also noticed this curve with the power lift ssb which very pricy at  for just the plain ssb in addition i cant do back squats because of my shoulders and i cant do front squats with the traditional form because of my wrists i figure if i shell out some extra cash i can have an awesome yoke like i wanted but i also get to train back squats front squats and cambered squats before i found the kabuki bar i was planning on getting the black widow front squat bar and a spider bar further down the lineill add that while my goals are not to compete in powerlifting lifting weights is pretty much the most important thing in my life hands down im building my home gym to be a strengthpower set up my focus is on powerlifting and strongman so any of you who have used this bar do you think the cost of the bar with all its variations are worth it over a traditional ssb how do the back squat front squat and cambered bar settings feel on the transformer,powerlifting
terms like meathead jock douchebag and probably my least favourite macho assholeim sorry that me deadlifting  makes you feel insecure around your girlfriend im sorry that you have to convince yourself that im stupid because i can squat  im sorry that you think you are physically better than me because you are functional when i can bench press you benching your  i dont hold you at gun point and stop you from lifting im just glad i have the physical and emotional strength to persist despite you trying to drag me down,powerlifting
i don’t compete but i’ve loved powerlifting since i started lifting at school about  years ago however the oly lifts have always amazed me because they require a lot of skill and technique i’ve never been that good at the snatch or cj but that only makes me want to get better so last night i stumbled upon what appears to be my perfect fit supertotal combining both powerlifting and olympic lifting in the same program now i had never heard of this before and there seems to be a really small community for it but i would love to hear your guys’ opinion on it and if you have an experience advice,powerlifting
hey ive recently been looking into ways of combining strength training specifically powerlifting with running not particularly long distances like marathons more like  kmif anyone has experience with the matter help me out with  how do you correctly manage fatigue say you have a lower body workout on monday and you have a running session on tuesday how would you change volumeintensity of the workout on monday to accommodate the run on  what is the best way of combining the two in terms of session frequency  days lifting  days running  could strength training directly impact running in terms of making it  what are some general guidelines for programming for endurance  for example when you go to the gym you have prescribed reps and sets scheme and a weight you need to lift how does it apply for endurance  would general strength training be better for endurance than training for powerlifting since powerlifting is a very specific form of  what are some good books or reading material i could look into that discuss this  what would be additional good information for me to know about the topic that i did not mention in the questionsfor general info im  im  meters tall and i weigh  kgsquat   kgbench   kgdeadlift   kgmy best  is  minutesenglish isnt my first language so i apologise in advance for any mistakes made spelling wise,powerlifting

as the title implies i simply cannot get my lumbar spine neutral before  initiating the pull i get into the correct position and the only  thing left to do is to make everything tight get my chest up and  straighten my lower backbut its just impossible it feels like i have  no control over it whatsoever after i got tired of my back always  hurting i decided to switch to sumo it didnt help a significantly  more vertical torso didnt allow me to get my spine neutral i can  barely get it straight with trap bar perhaps its a hamstring  flexibility issue but i just dont feel that they are tight when i try  to get into the correct position i touch them and they are almost soft  i have the same problem with squats i cannot go below parallel without  a buttwink could it be that my short torso and long ass femurs  prevented me from doing deadlifts ever again,powerlifting

i was having this conversation with my teamnates the other night and was curious as to how the rest of the community would respondso to everyone who recently built their home gym or is in the process will you be canceling your gym membership once the quarentine is liftedi canceled my most expensive membership because i was only using it to train during odd hours med student life  now with my home gym almost complete i can train at any hour   my teammates have also started building their home gyms and some of them wont be renewing their memberships or will train at their school gyms  im just curious to see other lifters plans,powerlifting

powerlifting is a sport who’s lifeblood is the small gym many small gyms are suffering like crazy right now and the end of this mess doesn’t seem around the cornerreading the ‘what’s your day job’ thread made me realize how many of us have day jobs that aren’t suffering during this crisis or maybe have some slight sense of affluence personally i work fb and this situation is not impacting me for the foreseeable future i’d like to use my privilege to help in some way and i’d like to call on others in this community to do the same if you cani’ve never put together a fund so if anyone has experience with this please let me know otherwise what i am proposing is a crowd funded pool of emergency money for small gym owners there would be some sort of application process and the amount of money possible to distribute would depend on how many people we can get involved in this this would not be a loan program this money would be a nostrings grant to our inneed gym ownersmaybe this idea is dumb or too challenging to administrate but it’s bullshit to not try,powerlifting

the past  years ive found my interest in powerlifting and have been basing my workouts around the squat bench and deadlift although i have never commited to a known program to try and improve my liftsim   lb and my current lifts are s  b  d  squat has been my only lift to improve within the last  months largely because i was in a calorie deficit that entire time and lost  lbs of body fat im now in the middle of a light bulk and looking to increase these liftsim following a  powerlifting program by kizen training omar isuf etc and the first thing ive noticed is how light the sessions are typically a workout only calls for  exercises im very accustomed to doing  sets per muscle group and burning out to exhaustion on most exercisesmy question is it ok to add some accessory exercises to the end of these powerlifting programs and if so how much intensity should be given here i hate walking out of the home gym feeling like i couldve done more and feeling unaccomplished,powerlifting
