1605877190,"There’s probably one area you feel like you can’t work enough: your abs. It seems like no matter how much training you do, the lower abs just stay the same. In order to lose weight and show muscle definition, you need to train the whole body. You need to expend calories—and pair that with a well-balanced diet.

&amp;#x200B;

It is important to train the core because that is your centre for balance. Plus, a strong core can help reduce back pain. Not sure exactly how to hit those lower belly muscles? You’re not alone. Lower abs are very difficult to strengthen because that is where our body stores most of its excess fat. And for women, the hormone oestrogen naturally wants to hold onto fat in this area.

&amp;#x200B;

But don’t worry, there are tons of exercises you can do to get rid of it. Here we have the most effective lower abs exercises as a workout. For three of these moves, you’ll need towels or sliders.

&amp;#x200B;

1. HEEL TAP:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to:

&amp;#x200B;

Lie face-up, hands under your butt, knees bent, feet lifted into table top position.

Slowly lower your flexed feet forward until your heels barely touch the ground.

Squeeze your abdominals to help raise your feet back up to table top.

2. MOUNTAIN CLIMBER:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to:

&amp;#x200B;

From a high plank position, with your body straight and hips level, lift right foot and draw right knee to chest between your hands.

As you return right leg to plank, lift left foot and draw left knee to chest between your hands.

Continue to alternate as quickly as possible, keeping your core tight and without hiking your hips.

3. SCISSOR:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to:

&amp;#x200B;

Lie face-up, hands behind your head, lifting head and shoulders off the floor.

Using your abdominals, lift legs slightly off the ground and scissor kick, alternating one up and one down.

Focus on not straining your neck or jutting your chin forward.

4. SLIDER PIKE:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You’ll need sliders or towels to pull off this move.

&amp;#x200B;

How to:

&amp;#x200B;

Start in high plank position with both feet on sliders.

Squeeze low abs and pull feet toward your hands, lifting your hips toward the ceiling into a pike position.

Slowly push feet out to lower into starting position.

5. STRAIGHT LEG RAISE:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to:

&amp;#x200B;

From a face-up position on the floor, place hands under your low back and brace your core.

Lift straight legs slowly off the ground, bringing them to 90-degrees, then slowly lower them back to the ground.

If you have any pain in your lower back, do not do this move.

1605874818,"Before all you humble people get on here and say “I wasn’t good at anything”, I know there was one thing you were just a little better at than everything else, relatively.  Whether that was strength, conditioning, gymnastics, etc.

For me, I was shocked at my ability to learn the gymnastics movements.  I had never done gymnastics a day in my life and can do 15-20 T2B and consecutive muscle-ups.  But on the flip side I am still terrible at (pretty much all) the Olympic lifts.  I thought that would be one of my strengths before I started but it’s turned out to be a massive weakness.

1605874151,"I am starting Crossfit again and general weightlifting after taking a break due to a lower back injury (muscle strain) and then triathlon training. I am starting from zero using Crossfit Linchpin at home, which has been awesome because there is no ego involved with chasing heavier weights than I could handle which was how I injured myself in the first place. That being said I am concentrating on improving my squat specifically my back squat because that was also the movement I injured myself with.

 I have been looking at all of the past weightlifting belt posts and seeing a trend of only using a belt at percentages over 70-80%. However, all of the weights that I am moving are usually over that because I am not lifting a lot and I only have a barbell and a pair of 10s and 25s. I think I know the answer already, but should I use a weightlifting belt to help enforce the bracing effect and add support/confidence to my back squat?

I'm pretty sure him inviting them to the ""party"" is not just out of ""you're are very nice guys and I want to know you better"", there's definitely a bit of ""I want to spread my new Crossfit direction to all over the world"". I don't say this as a bad thing, I think it's amazing that the new CEO understands the power of social media and is taking every opportunity he got to change people's perceptions of Crossfit.

I told her that sometimes if the bars aren't properly maintenance, that they can make a metal on metal sound, or something similar to a crunching sound. I then did a few thrusters with her bar and told her it was safe to continue. The look on her face was priceless, a mixture of relief, embarrassment, and happiness because she obviously had something to blame the noise on.

1605718482,"I have been doing CrossFit since the summer. I started after being overweight and depressed after splitting up with my wife. I decided it was time to at least attempt to get back into shape to help me not feel like shit all the time. When I first started, I absolutely dreaded going to class because I was so out of shape that the warm-ups would leave me out of breath. I couldn’t finish ANY WOD without at least severely scaling, if I was even able to finish at all. Well as the weeks passed, I went from 2-3 days a week to 4, and I’ve been going 4x a week consistently for a couple months now. And I’ve noticed something recently: I don’t get the sympathetic “just try your best” most of the time anymore, and it’s more like “cmon keep moving!”, and I actually really appreciate it. I’m still overweight (mainly due to diet), but I have still lost a decent amount of weight over the last few months. It’s nice to see how much progress I have made by going consistently over the last couple months. I absolutely love being pushed to my limits, and being surprised to what my body can actually do. It feels so good going from an obese person always being told “just do what you can” because I was in such poor physical health, to “cmon man, push harder!”, since I am someone who does better while being pushed by coaches and other members. It feels great to finally somewhat be EXPECTED to finish every workout, and I can thank all of my coaches for positively pushing me to my limits (mostly for cardio- they don’t push me to do more weights during lifts, fyi).

1605715914,"Hi guys,

I was just talking to my friend the other day, and he mentioned that basketball players who dunk off one leg tend to jump off from their weaker side and dunk with their dominant hand.

*(Eg. A right handed player who jumps off from their left foot and dunks with their right hand)*

***For reference, look at this picture. You can clearly see MJ jumping off his left foot (non-dominant side) and dunking with his right hand (his dominant side).***

[https://vault.si.com/.image/c\_fit%2Ccs\_srgb%2Cfl\_progressive%2Cq\_auto:good%2Cw\_620/MTY5MDk4NzMyODU5NjMxMDY3/image-placeholder-title.jpg](https://vault.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY5MDk4NzMyODU5NjMxMDY3/image-placeholder-title.jpg)

He mentioned that by jumping off your weaker side and dunking with your opposite side, you would have an extended reach to the basket. However, I don't really understand the mechanics behind this concept, as you would most likely suffer from a decreased vertical by leaping off a weaker side, and I don't really see how you would gain increased reach through this practice.

Wouldn't it make more sense logically to jump off your dominant leg and dunk with that same dominant hand? (Jumping and Dunking off the same side)? Wouldn't that theoretically give you a higher peak point due to the fact that there is more explosiveness and speed in your leap?

*(Eg. A right handed player who jumps off from their right foot and dunks with their right hand)*

Therefore, are there any mechanical differences in jumping off on your dominant leg and also dunking on that same side? What type of impact would this unorthodox jumping style have on my hops? For instance, will this impact my overall vertical jump or my peak reach during the dunk?

I just don't really understand the advantages in which jumping off your weaker foot will give in terms of overall peak height attained during the jump. Could someone please explain the mechanics behind this please!! Thank you!",crossfit,Could someone please give me a scientific explanation of the Mechanics behind a one-footed vertical jump?

Gym opens back up in May per our governors guidelines and I don’t go. For 6 months. He would text me every now and then to check up on me. I never once though about cancelling. I liked the option... probably why planet fitness does so well. 

The reason I didn’t go back was because I was so anxious. Not about being around people or anything ( we are well spaced and can be in open air). But because I literally thought I was going to die. Like literally, I was so worried about being out of shape....even though I’ve already started from scratch once. 

The sleeping in was also nice. 

Fast forward to last Friday. I texted him and asked if Monday would be a good day to start. He said of course and told me they would scale it. I honestly didn’t believe him. He literally was right there with me the whole day. Scaled everything for me and made sure I was ok. I didn’t tell him why I hadn’t been back, but I feel like he knew. And of course, when I was walking out said ‘see you tomorrow’ with a grin.

Hello everyone, 

I am a Provisional Psychologist completing a Master of Clinical Psychology and I am looking for participants to take part in a 20-25-minute survey as part of my thesis. The research project aims to investigate the link between positive core beliefs (i.e., schemas) and eating behaviour. 

The research is primarily focused on helping individuals with disordered eating behaviour and not directly related to Crossfit; however, I am also looking for healthy controls for the research, and what better place to go than the Crossfit community. It will be good to have input from people who follow different types of lifestyle philosophies. 

Individuals who complete the survey will go into the draw to win one of four $50 Amazon gift cards, but more importantly, the research will contribute to the development of novel approaches to treating eating disorders, such as the inclusion of schema therapy and positive psychology.

Please feel free to share the link with your professional and non-professional networks. A detailed information page is presented when first accessing the survey. You do not have to have an eating disorder to participate in the survey.

I appreciate your time and I am happy to answer any further questions you may have.

1605226998,"I got into an argument about who had a more impressive CrossFit resume so I put this together... a points system ranking of the best all-time Male Crossfit Games Athletes (hope to do the woman's side as well). We all know Mat and Rich are the 1 and 2. But who is the 8th? What about the top 20? Thought it would be fun to try to answer that. Tell me whatcha think!

**How'd I Do It?** 

Note 1 - What competitions did I consider?

Only the Crossfit Games were considered. I think there is an argument for considering things like the Open and Regionals/Sanctionals. I decided against it as the Games are the pinnacle of the sport. That is where we ultimately judge success and failure.

Note 2 - All the Games? Or just modern?

I considered ""tiering"" Games by year so that performance in the 2018 games is more valuable than the 2009 games. It's quite clear there is a different level of fitness now compared to the early days. However, deciding how to tier each year was too difficult. While it's clear there is a huge difference between the very early and modern games, it's not clear where the ""line"" is. How much more impressive is a 2017 games win vs 2013? I don't know how to answer that. What I decided to do was only consider the 2010 games and on. The '07, '08, '09 games are just too different from today. This isn't perfect, Graham Holmberg's 1st place in 2010 is a completely different accomplishment than any of Fraser's. But we do this in other sports too, we talk about Bill Russel and Jerry West as all-time greats when in reality if they were transported to the modern-day NBA LeBron would dominate them. So take Jason Kahlipa and Chis Speiler's ranking with a grain of salt. I also only considered athletes who had competed at the games at least 3 times. (sorry Medieros, who would have tied for 20th)

Note 3 - Point System

There is a tone of different ways to do this. I prioritized wins, podium finishes, and top 10 finishes. The grouping towards the bottom is mostly due to laziness, made things a lot easier. 

Here is the breakdown...

1605222550,"Hi, 

I was doing CF.  My wrist kept getting hurt and every week I went I would get sick (correlation or causation I don't know). I was going to go back again, but I realized that it didn't make sense that I kept getting hurt when my coach was watching me. I am not sure why they didn't recommend wrist guards or tell me I was doing the workout wrong.   


I started looking into their certs and they have level 1, level 2, and a few of the other ones like scaling. As far as I know, typically trainers are supposed to have either NSCA, NASM, ACSM, or at least ACE certs. I am torn: Do I keep going to this box despite the coach not having these certs or do I continue to go and basically do things at my pace? (When we did workouts for time I'd do my best, push myself, and if I started feeling dizzy I'd slow down).

Im currently at 195lbs, 19.5% body fat, work a desk job but do crossfit 6 times a week and usually a casual tennis the 7th day and was looking to shed some body fat while still maintaining or gaining lean muscle. Ive been on 240g protein, 240g carbs, and 53g of fat (40,40,20) for a total of 2,400 calories per day. I got these calculations from reading and watching jeff nippards recomp videos where he says to lose body fat 1.2 x lbs for protein intake, 20% fats, and fill in the rest with carbs and take off 10-20% off your maintenance calories. I had previously been doing 3,200 cals a day, gained about 3lbs but put on very little fat (~1%), then i took it down to 2,800 calories and found this was my maintenance calories so from this calculated my macros according to jeff nippards formula. I follow this on the dot and count my macros everyday and get carbs from complex carbs and not simple carbs (oats, sweet potato, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, fruits etc) but mainly eat the same thing everyday. I have a withings body + scale which tracks all of my data to keep track. They say that you should be losing ~1lb per week which would equal 1% of body fat.

I did events 1-4 on Saturday, event 5 on Sunday and finished event 6 and 7 on Monday. It wasn’t a perfect mirror of the actual competition but it was certainly plenty for me, and just made me seriously impressed at how all the athletes tore apart some of these workouts.

1) I kind of prefer the feeling of my hands on the bar (it just feels more secure to me)

 2) when I wear them I can't properly wrap my hand around the pull up bar and I've tried this with a variety of rigs/bars.

But I'm scared that I'll loose the weight but put on too much muscle and I'm back at square one with my confidence. 

Also I've heard that most people go to crossfit 4-5 times a week. With my schedule, 2 times is probably the best I can do if I want to keep up my social life.. will I even make any progress?

I'm also very scared of not being able to do as many reps or lift as much weight as others and then being written off as the ""lazy fat girl"".. even though I've been there a few times and everyone seems super supportive, I've only had one on one lessons so far and I'm going to start group class in a week.

Been doing Crossfit for many years, and wanted to get more serious about it from August 2019. Wanted to really make it ""big"" in this years Open, as i have climbed to rank #200 in Norway in the last 2 years. Worked out 8 times pr week on average. I also run alot.

Started getting pain in my left knee, and by Februar 2020 i could barely walk on my left foot. My right foot had/has minor pain.
Got an MR at the hospital, confirming Jumpers Knee in both knees. Pretty severe in the left, almost nothing in the right.

Started doing the following:

February 2020:
3 times pr day: Eccentric workout :20 air squats on each foot by lifting the foot not doing the lifting up so that only the toes were touching the groud. The foot with the jumpers knee infection would then have all the weight coming down.(3 seconds going down) Once at the bottom of the squat, the support foot would come down and both feet helps me go back up.
Started feeling pain after a while, and stopped. 

March-June 2020
Did nothing between April and June and waited for the pain to go away.

June
Pain still there. Went to a chiropractor who started doing Shockwave therapy, have had about 15 procedures now. 

November
About 80% better due to the Shockwave Therapy, but far from ok. Tried 2-3 workouts at my local crossfit and thats a no go. Running is also an absolute no go. 
Went to a doctor who suggested i started doing the eccentric workout again, 3 times pr day with 20 reps (3 seconds down)

For real starting to get severly depressed by this, as working out is a huge part of my life. 

Can anyone share some tips or advice?

Im currently an instructor in weightlifting only, some people from crossfit come to my classes and some of them tell me that weightlifting in crossfit is different. Normally because the speed needed or fatigue make them change the technique. I've been watching several crossfit games videos with weightlifting movement. Sometimes there are slight variances, but i think most of the time that's because inter-personal movement variability. 

the only moment when i see some difference is when a big amount of light snatches is presented and they may change some of the hip/torso angles. Can someone enlighten me?

Personally, I think they should learn basic weightlifting technique and once the stabilize it, change on what they find more efficient inside the crossfit WOD.

As for myself, I’ve been doing weightlifting for 7 years and my weight is around 169lbs.

What’s ironic is that the workout afterwards were a G2OH on 115lbs but I was so drained out from the previous workout that I even lost there...

So how do I improve my resting between reps? Should I jump onto some EMOM work or how do you guys do to. I guess there’s some more cardio work needed too... Guess I’m just asking for some feedback.

Been doing Crossfit for about 3 years now. Started as a completely unathletic person. Part of why I started was because I have some pretty serious perfectionism and negative self talk issues; I wanted to force myself to do something I would suck at. (and of course I graduated college and knew my metabolism wouldn't keep up for much longer, and I should probably start taking care of my body)

In a lot of ways the three years have worked alongside other effort I've been taking to expose myself to what I call voluntary discomfort. But now that I'm not a complete rookie, and I've found I have a pretty natural inclination for oly lifts, I'm starting to be really insanely upset with myself for not being as good as I think I should be. 

I've gotten to a point where now during wods I pendulum swing from thinking ""I can't do this workout/what's the point"" to ruthlessly berating myself for having those thoughts and struggling while the person next to me is flying through their pull-ups. OR I struggle to know if I'm scaling appropriately or sandbagging.

I know this may sound ridiculous, especially if you've always been an athlete or if you're very neurotypical. I'm not being dramatic and I don't want pity. 

I'm looking to see if anyone else has struggled with this and found somethings that have worked for them. I'm sure I'm not the only one who could benefit from this conversation.",crossfit,Mental Health/Mental Resilience Practical Advice?

1604001911,"Hi all, 

I'm about 2 years into Crossfit and one of my next goals is to feel comfortable and build on my snatch and overheard mobility. Right now, it's really challenging for me to put the barbell (on it's own) over my head and get a full squat going.   


What steps can I take to work on feeling comfortable in that position? What will help me get more flexible and add more weight eventually? Thanks for your help!",crossfit,Overhead Mobility and Squatting Help
1603995441,"I started CrossFit in my 40's with absolutely 0 background in anything athletic.  I tweaked my back/shoulders/arms multiple times and it took me 2 years to understand how much flexibility helps as mine was hot garbage. While the gyms were shut down I really focused on shoulder and back mobility and sweet jesus does it ever help when you can get in a proper position where your muscles don't feel like they are about to tear. How much easier a squat is when the bar is actually in-line with your center of gravity and you're not constantly fighting against being pulled forward or keeping your elbows high. I remember not being able to OHS an empty bar, now it's a favorite lift because it's something most people consider difficult that I do really well. 

I like to think of lifting as 33% Strength/33% Technique/33% Flexibility. Obviously without good flexibility you can't have good technique. How many times did a coach try and move my body into a proper position and my body just couldn't do it....I really wish I had focused waaay more on flexibility from the start as 2 years in, my strength has gone through the roof but my 1RM's suffer because my best clean is a muscle clean, my best snatch a muscle snatch.  Yes my flexibility is better but I'm not close to being done yet. Gowod tells me my posterior chain mobility is 13% (go me!!). Now 2 years in I need to learn how to get comfortable with squat snatch and squat clean like I'm new off the street because only in the last couple of months has my front rack gotten to the point where I can squat that way. The feeling where a year ago I hit a 200lb front squat but my back screamed at me for days after and I was seriously a year where my body refused to allow me to front squat at all without feeling seriously compromised. A few weeks ago I did a few sets of 5 and worked up to 250 and it felt good, like magic, all because of my positioning. The difference between fighting the bar to stop it from rolling down my arms to it just sitting cradled on my shoulders effortlessly.

I'm at the gym 5 days a week and this year is the first time where nothing hurts (the bad kind of hurt as all crossfitters hurt) because I'm not pushing my muscles and joints to their limits. 

This was a very long public service announcement to focus on your mobility every bit as much as you work on your technique and strength as it's every bit as important! (probably more) :-)",crossfit,Stretching may be boring and it took me 2 years to actually appreciate just how critical good mobility is.

1603796103,"Hello everyone.

Let's begin with some numbers. BSQ: 255. FSQ: 205. DL: 365. CL: 182. Strict press: 138. Jerk: 155. Power snatch: 122. Squat snatch: 88 (😳)

In my first year of crossfit I just started at my local box which just opened up. I wanted to lose weight, so I did that. Lost 43 lb. in my first year. 
In my second year of crossfit I started to gain weight to gain some muscle mass. Gained around 31 lb. 

These past months I have begin cutting and now I'm back to around 176lb at 5'10. 

When I started crossfit I told everyone I'd be competing some day, even if it was locally. I did try a competition 10 months back and got smashed. Since then I've upped my body weight and lifting numbers. For instance my DL upped 72 lb and BSQ 32 lb. 

But I want to up my game. I don't feel ready to start competing while I want that, really badly. 

Looking at my numbers I need to improve strenght wise. While my technique needs some serious work. My power snatch and squat snatch are way too apart (looking at you shoulder mobility). My jerk is too low compared to my strict press... etc.

I've been doing classes 5-6 days a week for years now. But I'm thinking to cut that back to 2 and start my own programming on the side. 

Basically I want to train 3-4 days a week in a strenght / oly lifting way. I'm looking for a programm which would fit in there. On these days I'd also like to add gymnastic work and mobility training. 

I'd still like to workout 5-6 days a week, while I could possibly go twice a day on two days.

1603759857,"A big thing we talked about in this sub this weekend was how no one seemed to be pushing Tia/Mat for the wins in certain events but I rewatched some events and kinda thought: transitions played a big role!

Some examples I can think of off the top of my head:

* During the T2B/lunge event, Tia setting her bells in the middle of the rig, which is how she beat Katrin in the round of 10
* Happy Star: for the last few hill sprints, Brooke Wells did have to run farther as the sprints moved more to the left of the field of play, but she wasn't moving faster to compensate for that
* Swin 'n' Stuff: getting in and out of the GHDs to the med ball slams, in and out of the pool onto the bike/GHD

This is all to ask: sometimes I wonder, when it's not a matter of fitness, how is the rest of the field fumbling transitions like that? Tia and Mat definitely have the gameplay of competitive CrossFit down, and it's interesting to me that it's a meta-skill that is not as sharp across the field at that level.

His programming for years was excellent, with both the unknown aspects, balance of fitness across many domains, and ""fun to watch""-ness all in a delicate harmony. However, the past couple years have simply not been acceptable. The idea of cutting an entire field after a single event, or imposing harsh penalties for stepping on a line may simply have been a poor judgement calls, didn't seem fair to the idea of broadly testing fitness. This year the last minute additions of the 0-points-for-inadequate-effort was not in keeping with the spirit of the games.

But the absolute worst and unforgivable choice was the ""twist ending"" of the trail run to have them run the course again in reverse. He deliberately misled them about the event itself. That is undoubtedly a great mental test of fortitude *if you were training...* but **terrible** for a competition. This is completely different than the ""Chaos"" event, when athletes new they'd make their way across a field with a variety of exercises but not now reps and exercises in advance. The unknown aspect then was known. What if at the end of the 100 meter sprint-sled-sprint he had said ""no just kidding that isn't the event, now go row a half marathon"".

If you were designing a test for the fittest on earth and were specifically doing 1 workout to test each of the 10 elements of fitness, what would you program for the 10 workouts?

So to be clear, the total 10 would be 10 workouts long, each one trying to isolate one of the elements of fitness.  Not necessarily trying to make it interesting to watch, but the best test you can think of for each element.

The 10 elements are:

 

1. **Cardiovascular / respiratory endurance** – The ability of body systems to gather, process, and deliver oxygen.
2. **Stamina** – The ability of body systems to process, deliver, store, and utilize energy.
3. **Strength** – The ability of a muscular unit, or combination of muscular units, to apply force.
4. **Flexibility** – The ability to maximize the range of motion at a given joint.
5. **Power** – The ability of a muscular unit, or combination of muscular units, to apply maximum force in minimum time.
6. **Speed** – The ability to minimize the time cycle of a repeated movement.
7. **Coordination** – The ability to combine several distinct movement patterns into a singular distinct movement.
8. **Agility** – The ability to minimize transition time from one movement pattern to another.
9. **Balance** – The ability to control the placement of the body’s center of gravity in relation to its support base.
10. **Accuracy** – The ability to control movement in a given direction or at a given intensity.

1603729631,"Pretty entertaining Games this year despite the format changes, etc.  I definitely missed having more competitors, but it was nice to see everyone competing at once as far as a viewing experience goes.

With that said, I found I was constantly annoyed by the commentary on winning events in CG Games.  For instance, the commentators would say something like ""This is Mat's 12th event win at the CF Games for his career"" (making that number up... don't know what his current tally is).  

I take literally nothing away from Mat or Tia for winning the 2020 Games.  They were very clearly head and shoulders above the rest and there is really no argument anyone can make to the contrary.... BUT, you can't weigh the event wins from this year the same as prior years.  When you only have 4 other competitors in the field, it's much easier to win any given event.  Winning an event against 40 competitors is MUCH more impressive because you are beating people who might be specialists or for whom this might be a wheelhouse workout.  I'm not saying the 4 other people in the field didn't deserve to be there, but counting these wins alongside winning Double DT or Mary from last year is just silly.

Obviously none of this matter in the grand scheme, but I hope they have some way of recognizing how much harder it is to win events in a field of 40 or the larger fields from last year.",crossfit,2020 Games Asterisks?

1603690608,"Some people have criticized that we don't see enough competition for first place in the events. And that seems to be true. Few people are really going all out and collapsing after the events. It happens but it's rare. People who you would expect could win an event don't even seem to try.

I think the main reason is the way the prize money is structured. There's money to be made for your placement in the games, not the events. So if you can't win the games it makes more sense to game the system and play for second. It's better to finish every event second than to win an event and burn yourself out for the next three. That's why we don't see people going all out and why the games have become homogenized with few specialists and few outstanding individual performances.

So what if that got flipped on its head? My idea was to reward individual event performance. What if winning the games gave the athlete a prize of 70k (second gets 35k, third gets 20k). But wining an event was 20k (with 5k for second). The total money handed out would roughly stay the same for the organizers but it would be spread around more and winning each event would come with its own reward.

Athletes would be willing to really leave it all on the field because winning two events would be better than to come in second overall. So each athlete would have to push themselves to really make the events where they could win count.  
We would see the return of specialists. Strength monsters and endurance runners. People who would get fit enough overall to qualify and specifically come in to win their part of the games. And be rewarded for that performance.  
And we might see some changes at the top. Because a Mat or Tia might really have to retool their training. Faced with the 100% effort of specialists and people willing to race them to the finish line and leave it all out on the field they would be faced with the choice to ""just"" win the games (maybe by placing second and third in each event while the specialists got a mix of first places and bottom placements) for a low amount of prize money or fight for some wins to up their earnings at the risk of maybe burning out and losing the game.

TLDR: New to CF, have lower back issues, but do not want to quit. How can I protect it assuming good form will not come overnight. 

I’m M, 43 and fairly active. I’ve ALWAYS wanted to do CF but have had a history of lower back issues despite my fitness level. I’m addicted to exercise however and have literally just modified my workouts for years. This meant avoiding A LOT of different movements, especially any of those that required a bent back. Deadlifts, good mornings, etc. 

I am literally TIRED of my back. I want to literally ignore this issue and I “talk to” my back and body all the time. I decided to just give CF a go and went for the first time ever on Saturday. In the set there was clean and jerks in the WOD. More then I’ve ever done in my life. Today my back is pissed but not injured. I’ve iced, hot tub, stretched and I want to go back tomorrow to do another workout. 

If you are reading this and have back issues but have been in the CF game for a while, what is your strategy? How do enjoy this sport with this back of mine? I do not want to give up or quit.",crossfit,Lower Back Issues vs CrossFit (newcomer question)

1603643770,"As beginner I am a bit confused, when I take a look at ""benchmark WODs"" but as well at the WODs I encounter in the classes: there's a variety of people in a class with different sizes and bodyweights etc., but they are supposed to perform the exercises with the same weight (only separated by gender). So I was wondering, why not working more often with BW percentages, when it comes to barbell exercises for example? Wouldn't it be easier to compare WOD performances with class-mates this way? And also, it appears more reasonable to me to track my own progress, because my bodyweight might change over the years of training and therefore former strength values are not useful to look at anymore.

I already asked ony of my coaches but he actually didn't know what to answer. Btw, I know that WODs are being scaled, but that is not the point of my question. (And sorry, I am not a native speaker)",crossfit,beginner's question: why are most WOD exercises specified to be performed with absolute kg values?

But due to kids, work, COVID, house extension, laziness I’ve had pretty much a year off,  but in a few weeks time my garage gym will be back in action so I’ll have no excuses... but where to start.

Ive been doing F45 and BFT for a couple years now and PT since iso.. my question ive built up a fair amount of strength in the PT sessions (3 times per week) focusing on compound lifts.

1603558722,"Hi everyone

So I'm 194.8cm (6ft4) and around 240lbs, wanting to get down to around 220, and am interested in hearing some stories of bigger athletes having some success at comps, as well as what you think the maximum height and weight to compete at an elite level would be? (Say finishing towards the top of regional level)

Obviously with having a bigger ROM, and carrying extra weight, it could make it more difficult, but then I guess it helps with monostructural events, ski erging, rowing etc. Along with mental strength playing a big part. 

I know there's been a few bigger guys like Aja Barto, but feel like he maybe might not have had as much success if he was competing now, and a few other bigger guys like Brent Fikowski, Garett Fisher etc. Have there been any others?

I noticed it when someone was cutting short the programmed rest in a metcon, and it got me suspicious. Started talking to other members about it, and I wasn’t the only one who noticed it. 

Personally, I don’t really get validation anymore from being near the top of the leaderboard, but it’s annoying to see people say they Rx’d a workout when they scaled reps or note on the whiteboard that they got a lower time than they actually did. 

I’m fully aware that they are doing themselves a disservice, but it’s really frustrating for those of us who worked for months to over a year to regularly Rx workouts. 

The coaches recognize when people are cheating, but it’s one of those things where they simply clarify what Rx standards are without really enforcing it. I’m wondering how often this happens at other boxes and what is done to curb it.",crossfit,How to address cheating at your box?

1603490284,"I have recently been thinking about trying CrossFit.  I might be one of the few people that's lost weight over quarantine (almost 50 lbs), mostly through diet.  Though I feel like I lost a little bit of muscle along with the weight and would like to get stronger.  I also regularly train in martial arts, karate specifically.  I currently take karate classes, 2-3 times a week.  And it's generally a pretty good workout (obviously the main focus is not always conditioning but technique).  Also, part of my desire to be in better physical shape is because I may test for black belt sometime next year (who knows what the world will be like by then) and the testing is particularly physically arduous and lasts about 24 hours.  I would like to make it through it without feeling like I'm going to die.

My hesitation with CrossFit is that I'm not looking for another hobby.  I help teach karate and generally help out a lot at the school, so that is the focus of my attention when it comes to my free time.  It seems like for a lot of people CrossFit is to them what karate is to me. But I'm just looking for a workout, and I'd probably only be able to go once or twice a week.  Is it worth it for me?  I'm not super great at self-motivating at the gym that's one of the reasons I started taking martial arts, so the idea of someone laying out the workout appeals to me.  I'm also interested in being able to lift more.  I'm just not sure the cost of going to one of the gyms is worth it if I'm not planning on getting as into it.",crossfit,CrossFit Along with Karate?

#Event 2: Corn Sack Sprint

**For time:**

1603462353,"If you watch Armen Hammer's YouTube channel, you know he's no fan of Dave Castro, but is this his most overt attack yet?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsF3eLhGzlw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsF3eLhGzlw)  


3:36 - Armen basically called Dave vindictive for repeating a sled event, and says Dave, ""can't let go"".  
6:05 - He suggests Dave's an egomaniac for reprogramming so many events, stating, ""This is a workout that of course, Dave Castro loves, because he wrote it.""   
7:24 - He (correctly) calls out Dave and the rest of the Games' decision makers the new ""full effort"" rule. It's an unapologetic attack on everything from the concept, to how it was rolled out, to how it'll never be used.  
13:50 - He suggests people watch his live feed of him watching the Games so you can hear ""live reactions from people who aren't on CFHQs payroll"". 

Never mind throwing shade, that's straight up two double birds thrown in Castro's direction. And it is glorious! I just hope is doesn't talk himself out of access to future interviews with and events.",crossfit,Armen drops the hammer on Castro

1603461382,"I just wanted to post this so people could let each other know which channel they’re following between events at the games. I’m assuming the official CrossFit channel will have the best footage, but other channels often have better or more entertaining analysis. Let us know!",crossfit,Best Talk Show during CrossFit Games

We're off with event 1, and it's a classic based off an event from the 2007 CrossFit games. Heavier and more complex movements that the athletes will have to rip through! Big fan of this one, and I expect some fun

1603433358,"When I first started working out at my box I had just slightly messed up my knee, probably from being sore all the time and from running while heavy.

I’ve lost 50 lbs since then but a few weeks ago I twerked my knee again. The other knee this time. We had a leg heavy week, and then had a wod with sumo deadlifts, deadlifts, etc and a 1 mike run after. Halfway during the run, I felt my knee tingling and part of my hamstring feeling numb.

Now, my knee doesn’t hurt but it feels really wrong. My coach is telling me to workout and come in and modify. But when I came in for a leg workout, even the modified exercises feel weird.

TLDR: Yes, nothing hurts but it feels extremely stiff. It’s been about 3 weeks the same now. Every day after I wake up from light stretching it feels very warm (hot or burning even) and stiff. I tell people it feels like there’s a rubber band in my knee that feels taut.

1603408568,,crossfit,Been working on these for awhile now. Starting to see some improvement finally. Overhead strength has always been difficult for me. But it’s improving!

https://games.crossfit.com/article/how-watch-final-stage-2020-crossfit-games/games

CBS is showing two hours of Games 2020 coverage on Saturday. It’s great that it’s on broadcast media, but what’s the logic behind showing a couple hours of the middle with no “winner by the end of the broadcast” payoff?",crossfit,Why is CBS covering two hours on SATURDAY?
1603406669,"As the above says! When I row more than about 5 minutes I start getting lower back pain and I’ve no idea what’s causing it.

I can squat/deadlift/burpee no pain in my back at all, so I’m assuming it’s technique.

Im a very large dude who has a background in powerlifting and strongman, but I've had enough of being 380lbs and lifting heavy numbers, I want to lose weight and get more into shape. I've switched over to a crossfit style of training but can't do most crossfit movements due to my size so I'm just making stuff up as I go. I have no idea what kind of times someone who is actually in shape can do on these wods though and being of that powerlifter mindset it would just help to motivate me to have a better goal in mind to push myself to complete these wods faster. Anyways I'll post a few below. As you'll notice they may be a bit random.

1) complete as fast as possible/50lb KB
25 KB sumo DL high pulls
25 KB press (touch ground with KB each rep)
25 KB swings
25 KB press (touch ground with KB each rep)
25 KB goblet squats

2) complete as fast as possible

10 sandbag to shoulder (100lbs)
15 calories assault bike
10 sandbag to shoulder (100lbs)
9 calories assault bike

21 calories rower (10 resistance) 
10 weighted step ups (20 inch/50lbs)
15 calories rower(10 resistance) 
10 weighted step ups (20 inch/50lbs)
9 calories rower (10 resistance) 
10 weighted step ups (20 inch/50lbs)

3)for time

5000m rower (10 resistance) 

4) complete as quick as possible 
200 power cleans/ 135lbs

5) as quick as possible 

10 reps bench (135)
10 calories rower (10 resistance) 
Repeat 10 times

1603367037,"Happy Games eve y'all. 

Everyone of course works out to different music, from metal, to rap, to country. For me it depends on the kind of workout I'm going for (I'll listen to more chilled country if i'm just working on slower lifts for instance). 

For years though I've tried to find music that gets me pumped during a metcon, makes me feel like I'm in the heat of a comp, but isn't too ""violent"" and aggressive, just strikes that right balance between good music, that swells at the right time to get me fired up when i need a little more juice.

I used to put the Fittest docs on when doing high intense cardio for instance, as they always seemed to nail the ""action star"" build up music (Starts slow to a big epic finish), but it's not a soundtrack that's available (I think it's Heeb's bro that did it...)

Anywho...finally....i come across **Audiomachine**. If you haven't listened to them, absolutely do so. It's instrumental, action film, intense, superhero style shit. Not in your face enough to be constantly distracting, but when it builds up, at least for me, it's fucking awesome and really pumps me up.

Few recommendations to start with (If these don't do it for you, it's probably not for you!)

Album : **Ascendance** (Their best, IMO, but they have tons of work out there)

Stand out tracks : 

* Centrifuge (Slow burner, kicks in around 1:30, if you can't imagine nailing Fran, or a power clean PR to it then you have no soul!)
* Access point 
* Through the Darkness (Kick in around 1:10)
* Dauntless (Kick in 1:00)
* Leap of Faith (Personal fave. Starts pretty gentle but stay with it....starts to ramp up around 1:15, then again 1:45. It always, always fires me up)
* Last 2 songs, Ninurta and Conquering Olympus, are both a bit darker in tone

It's a fantastic album to listen to non shuffled, it flows great. 

Honourable mention as my 2nd favourite album of their's is Volturnus, and then Cinematix (which is a little more experimental and almost Tron-like at times)

Give them a shot, hope you enjoy, and feel free to share any similar style albums/bands.",crossfit,"Workout Soundtrack Suggestion : Those who get pumped watching the ""Fittest"" docs"

The first crossfit workout I did was death by 10 meters. So it's only right that the hardest event in history be where I started. Cause I'm aight. I got a 600# deadlift, 500 I squat that. 

I don't know I think it would be neat thing. And it's possible. Atalanta raced dudes. If you won you got that sweet sweet prize. But if you lost you died. Dude this would be an insane event. Who the fuck is gonna stop?! For those that don't know death by 10 meters is  1 10 meter sprint first minute 2 next minute and so on. It's more mental than anything and that would be brutal. BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD STOP! We'd see it go to at least 25 minutes. And it makes sense, if you lose you die. And it's SUCH an old school workout. And that's the theme.

1603312730,"Hi Everyone, 

I have a question about continuing to push yourself when you are completely out of breath and your heartrate is sky high. 

Yesterday, I did 8 Rounds For Time Of:

8 Alternating DB Up-Downs

10 DB Goblet Squats

12 Alternating DB Snatch

Needless to say, it was TOUGH even though on paper it doesn't look so bad. But 4 rounds in I was just gassed. I have only been doing CF for about 3 months, but man, I was barely breathing, my HR was 179 and I was taking like 30 second breaks after each exercise. 

All of this, while others around me (admittedly far more fit than me) were pushing through and almost going unbroken. When I look at my HR monitor and see 179...I feel like I need to break so my HR doesn't go any higher and I can catch some breath...but do I really need this? 

Is it safe to just push through the suck and try to go unbroken? I KNOW I am capable of more than I was pushing myself yesterday, but I don't want to push so hard that I end up falling over or something embarassing like that lol. 

Any tips on pushing through the suck would help tremendously!

1603293660,"So I recently moved from the Midwest to the south. The town I moved to has one box within like a 30 mile radius. 

It’s pretty large, far larger than the gym I’m coming from. The gym I went to had a wide variety of athletes. I have only been doing CrossFit for around 7 months and maybe can RX half the workouts at my old gym. This gym is a different animal. 

This gym is insanely competitive and the WODs/classes are “custom” made by the owner for the most part. There’s a couple guys and girls who competed in previous games years back and still a few ranked in the top 500 or so currently.

So at my old gym we would warm up for around 15 minutes then get into the WOD that would last 12-30 min, then stretch together as a group with the time left.
This gym has you come in early to warm yourself up and there’s lifts before each WOD. Like I was excited to try awful Annie but we had to do a variety of squats for 10 minutes that left me already tired.

The people here are incredibly kind, they aren’t competitive in a bad way, and are all like a family. But I’m leaving workouts to the point that I can barely move my body, even scaled. I couldn’t lift my arms for nearly two days and they’re telling me to come in and work through it.

I want to keep to doing CrossFit but if there’s no where else around what do you recommend? 
I literally asked the owner/ head coach if I can skip the before WOD lifts to stretch and warm up, since I don’t plan on become a competitor, I just like doing WODs to stay active and fit. 

But he said very nicely that they want to the whole class on the same page.

The problem I have is I bought the cast plates, which are more narrow, and the straps the wrap underneath cannot both catch the plate.  Since the edges of the plate actually taper, one of the straps always slides up that tapered edge.  Twice now I've had a plate comes loose during a workout and completely drop down out of both straps (luckily stayed in the vest).

Has anyone figured out a workaround for this?  The cast plates say they are compatible with the 5.11 vest, but again I haven't seen a single video showcasing them used and it really just doesn't seem to fit well with the strapping provided.

In late January after CrossFit I came home and made dinner, then went for a shower, normal routine. About halfway through the shower, started to experience visual changes and decreased function of the lower extremities. I suspected it was low blood sugar and being fatigued. I quickly got out of the shower and fell to the floor with my vision going black for 30-60 seconds. I was able to walk downstairs and have some water and an orange. Around 1:15am Anne awoke to find me moving my extremities erratically. She noticed I was moving his right side less than his left side. At this point I was unable to speak or move my mouth. EMS was initiated and I was transported to the Hospital. I underwent a head CT upon arrival to the hospital. Although the CT was unremarkable, a CT-angio revealed a distal M1 occlusion. I was a candidate for intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV tPA) I was taken to IR and found to have a carotid dissection. I underwent thrombectomy and carotid angioplasty with stent placement. Thereafter he was admitted to the MICU.

Per the neurologist, I tore my right side carotid artery Monday doing deadlifts, then doing the clean and jerks two days later caused the scab to become loosened thus causing the stroke. Recovery has been tough for many reasons and COVID has made it very difficult. Physically I'm back to normal and have lost a ton of muscle and weight. The worst part is my vocabulary and speech patterns are back to 75%.

I practice the movement with a PVC pipe and can do it no problem, but as soon as there's ANY weight (even an empty bar), I feel the bar come forward a little bit and bail on the movement.

+ As many X in 10 minutes. Where X=burpees, wall balls, or calories on the bike. The idea here is to see the elites hit a wall and push through. I like this because I think it would really separate the field.
+ FIT. It's like the game HORSE or SKATE. Since there are only 5 athletes this might work this year only. Each athlete challenges his/her self to do a movement or set of movements in 2 minutes or less. If he she does so, then the others must attempt. If they fail, they get a letter. If they get three letters (FIT) they are out. Example—Athlete 1 challenges everyone to 20 unbroken muscles ups (or 50 calories in 30 seconds on the bike or a 2 minute dead hang, etc). If she or she completes the task, each person must then attempt it. Admittedly this is not well thought out but I like this because it adds mental strategy to the games. (What are my strengths? What are my opponent’s weaknesses?)
+ A military PT test. I like this one because 1) it can be repeated each year with tests from different branches/special forces/militaries from around the world. 2) It could be done at home so that we can compare. 3) It’s super relatable for anyone in the military who can say “wow that’s impressive!” or “Pft my Sarge used to do that as a warmup!” 4) If the military isn’t functional fitness then idk what is.

1602952074,"I have a sunny fitness magnetic resistance spin bike. It doesn’t have a dedicated monitor so I have to connect the extra wahoo sensors to my phone in order to see distance/RPMs. However there is no way for me to capture power output. 

I originally bought the bike to do occasional peloton workouts but I over estimated how frequent I would be doing such.   I’m currently doing Marcus Filly’s Persist program which incorporates biking. 

I’m interested in replacing the spin bike with a BikeErg due to the build quality of the bike and the great performance monitor. Always having to connect the sensors to my phone and pulling up the app is an inconvenience.  However I’m concerned about using the bike erg for the occasional peloton workouts. Would it be similar to a spin bike?. I’ve heard that BikeErg is pretty good as far as adjusting the levels of resistance, good for long endurance workouts and also high intensity interval‘s with a higher damper setting. 

Does any one have experience on riding a spin bike and the BikeErg and you can compare the two?

1602872979,"Hi! I've been doing CrossFit for a little over 6 years and have been very lucky to avoid most injuries throughout the years. I started noticing some low back pain three weeks ago after a heavy front squat that normally wouldn't have been a problem, I started experiencing what I thought was a hamstring strain. I had mild to moderate pain when bending over and figured I could train through it. A few days later, I started experiencing shooting pain down the back of my leg and a cramping sensation. I also experienced a water sensation. 

Two weeks ago, I went to a sports medicine PT to diagnose it. He believes (xray and MRI next week to confirm) I am dealing with a bulged disc in my lumbar spine based on the progression of my symptoms and the lack of any muscle involvement when trying to recreate the pain. I have no pain sitting or laying down, only when I initially stand up or try to recreate a squat or deadlift motion. 

I have taken the past 3 weeks off from the gym. I've avoided any barbell movements, any weighted exercise, and any high impact exercise (running, jumping). While I wait for my xray and MRI results and further guidance from my PT, **what can I do to stay active and retain my muscle I've gained?** I've done CrossFit for 6 years and as a naturally slender female, it took me SO long to build the quads, biceps, and traps that I have now.

I think I am in love! I’ve never felt better in my life physically. I have extremely greater mobility and strength. I do have a few questions! Sorry if they are annoying.

I’ve been going 5 times a week consistently. I did one-on-one sessions for a few weeks, and recently I started going to open-gym sessions to get some extra lifting or other programming in addition to the WOD.

Q’s:

1. Why am I so anxious about partner WODs? I can’t seem to want to go to them (They are on the weekend).

2. I can’t overhead squat. I can’t go low even with just the bar. I can’t figure out why. Any literature resources for tips?

3. My push jerk sucks. I can’t go heavy. How can I go heavier? Same with snatches. They kind of really suck. Anything overhead honestly.

4. My endurance sucks. How can I improve this?

5. Sore all the time that is it hard to sleep. Sometimes I feel like pulling out a pipe and taking a hit of something because it’s toouncomfortable to sleep. Lats, triceps, and hip soreness are usually the culprits.

6. How do I know if I am ready to advance a skill. I haven’t tried ring dips, or muscle ups, or HSPUs. I predict someone might say “just try it,” but like what if... I die or something? Any particular order I should advance?

7. Are using gloves during the WOD stupid? I bought some cause I want to keep my hands cute and soft, but someone called my hand protectors b*tch gloves. He said that my hands will get used to it. 

8. Most important question for last: why are some the guys who go to my box so delicious looking. Okay, I’m done.

1602711442,"Hi guys, just wondering if I could get some opinions and experiences

So I really enjoy CrossFit, both training wise, and just the whole ethos, people I train with etc. I'm currently doing my final year of my BSc Sports and Exercise Science degree in the UK and deciding what to do afterwards. I've had quite a few years worth of training (Not exclusively CrossFit, but at an elite sports level) as well as quite a bit of experience coaching people. I'm considering a physiotherapy masters after my degree, but thats another story...

One of the routes I'm thinking of going down is getting my CF level 1 coaching cert and start coaching people, however, I got my level 3 PT qualification a while ago and worked in a normal commercial gym training clients, and while I enjoyed teaching people, I feel most of the job was pretty much being a glorified sales person. It was literally just walking around the gym floor and cold calling people to try convince them they needed to buy PT sessions, and when they did, it was very rarely people who wanted to train and improve, rather just people who thought magically buying 10 hours of PT sessions would make them lose all their fat. 

So from my perspective, CrossFit coaching eliminates 'some' of these issues, people actually come there to train, and they come for group sessions, rather than me having to walk around a gym hunting for prospective clients. 

I'm just wondering if anyone could share some experiences they've had, or if you could just go over what some of the differences between each experience would be?

1602640289,"Years ago I read a book by a Soviet author(s?) that made the argument that **sports are inherently unsafe, and if adults' goal for children is to build up their bodies, children should pursue fitness instead of sports**. The author(s) argued health, not competition, should take precedence in the gymnasium. 

The oath of doctors says ""First, do no harm."" I think parents, and maybe more importantly, administrators of kids should adopt the same mindset, and I think **Crossfit is in a unique position (sorry for the GG phrase) to shift the conversation about children's physical development away from sports and toward fitness** because it combines the two in broad, flexible ways. 

If we could **refine Crossfit to a broader stable of safer movements and de-emphasize competition with anyone but oneself**, I think kids could get through childhood 1. with fewer injuries, and 2. prepared with the skills and mindset to exercise on their own post-graduation.

Heresy? Ideal but idealistic? Magneto's perfection?

1602631538,"One sentence backstory: I have a seriously damaged shoulder and if I want any hope of being an athlete for the rest of my life, I have to get surgery.

I have scheduled my surgery and I'm about two weeks out, and I am absolutely mortified, and I know I shouldn't be.

I have had this injury for a handful of years now but I have worked out with it anyway. It tends to not bother me unless I really stress the joint, but my shoulder will dislocate when I get sloppy, and since the last dislocation I have been pretty seriously debilitated. Of course, this (frankly minor) surgery is in my best interest, and could potentially allow me to perform Oly lifts and gymnastics for the rest of my life, things I cannot do now because of this injury.

However, I'll be one-handed for something like six months and not able to workout at capacity for another six. Exercise, specifically CrossFit, has become part of my identity in recent years, and I don't think I've gone more than a week without training ever since I started.

1602627233,"Guys, I had to quit after 5 years of being a committed 6 days a week CrossFit athlete. 2 years ago I ran into financial trouble and had to cut costs where I could, I sold my car, shopped at the dollar store and quit all “extracurricular” activities. I finally have enough money again to afford CrossFit. However, I am very anxious about it. A box in my area, that I went to for about 9 months recently opened a second location and did a promo code for the first 50 members to sign up for the new location would get 3 months at 100$ for either locations. So I jumped on it, but I just feel like everyone is going to remember me as what I used to be, and right now I am nowhere near that. Over the pandemic I would go on some runs, do some dumbbell work with what I had but that’s it. I haven’t lifted a barbell nor seen a rig in over 2 years. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has been through something similar and can give some feedback. Thanks.",crossfit,Restarting after 2 years off

1602614743,"I'll start off by saying that I have been doing Crossfit for 5 years. I'm quite mediocre. I'm not a competitive person and I've never been one to push myself extremely hard. I see others shave reps so they will not be last to finish a workout, but I will gladly finish last in order to complete a workout honestly. Competition and pushing yourself is a big part of Crossfit and at times I've wondered if maybe it wasn't the right fit for me because that isn't something I find myself interested or invested in. Let me be clear that I do put effort into workouts, but I don't push myself to the extremes like many athletes do. 

For years now, I have dealt with a fellow gym goer that clearly did not like me. I give her space, leave her alone; I don't try to interact with her. I know she talks shit about me and recently she's been making pretty rude comments to me in front of others. After the most recent comment, a mutual friend finally disclosed why she dislikes me so much; it's because she thinks I am weak. 

I think this bothers me so much because she has scratched the surface of one of my insecurities. I don't push myself like a lot of other Crossfitters but clearly it is not enough of an issue that I have changed it. It would be silly to change myself just to prove this person wrong. 

I don't know exactly what I am looking for here. Maybe I am looking for other people who approach Crossfit like me. Maybe Im looking to hear from a Crossfitter who also gets irritated by people who don't push themselves to the edge. Maybe Im looking to hear that pushing yourself in workouts isn't the only form of mental toughness. I would just love to hear some thoughts from others.

I am 6ft 1 and around 85kg at the moment and have gotten very lean as a result of doing Crossfit over the past few months. I train often twice a day (including my rugby training) and my calorie intake definitely isn't what it should be. As a result, I run the risk of getting more and more lean. Whilst aesthetically it's a nice problem to have, it will begin to have an impact on my Crossfit performance and weight lifting ability. 

My question then is, what weight should I be? Is there a golden ratio of height to weight for cross fitters? I can imagine being too heavy, whilst beneficially for big 1RM is detrimental for some of the gymnastics and running for example. Similarly, being too light has its own problems. 

Appreciate there are a number of metrics at play that shouldn't be overlooked but I wondered whether anyone had a similar experience. It looks like most cross fitters sit around 90KG but given my height that might not be optimal.

1602357212,"So about a month ago I posted on here trying to see it was realistic or feasible for me to try crossfit. I have been getting increasingly overweight and quarantine certainly did not help my eating habits and activity levels. However, I was SUPER intimidated because of how overweight I was, how intimidating some of the workouts looks, and doing a class in a group (self conscious).  Everyone here was absolutely supportive and encouraging, and I decided to give it a try!

The first week I was incredibly sore, to the point that I couldn't walk quite normally. Almost everything had to be modified/scaled.  However, everyone at the box was incredibly friendly and supportive! The coaches made sure to take extra time with me to see what my ability is, and help me with correct form before doing anything with weights. I was really struggling with recovery, and a member gave me about a month of protein shake mix to help my recovery (I always thought these were a gimmick, but oh my gosh it helped so much). I have also been focusing on my eating, increasing veggie and protein intake, and cooking my meals as obviously most weight loss happens at home.

In only 4 weeks, it has been so fun to see the progress I have made. I don't know my current stats (I can update in a few weeks when I get another body scan), but I have been able to have longer endurance, lift more, and modify less. The first week I struggle to row 500m in 10 minutes, and last week I did 6000m in 35! Not the best time for sure, but an incredible increase in my abilities. I no longer get winded going up the stairs at work. The craziest thing is I actually am looking forward to getting up to workout at 6am...I have never, ever been someone excited to exercise. Ever. So this is huge for me. I get massages about once a month, and my masseuse asked if I was doing something different as she could tell I had built some muscle as well!

Anyway, I am just trying to put my experience out there because I know it can be hugely scary to start crossfit when you are not in shape, and I want you all to know that it is completely do able and you will probably love it. I am so glad I started this, and cannot wait to see how much more I will be capable of and how my quality of life will change.

1602300168,"Wow. This bar is good.  

This bar has probably ruined the Rogue Ohio Bar for me, and I LIKE the Ohio bar.  I've owned 3 of them. (New finish? New color? submit order!)

[So what about the AB California?](https://imgur.com/6HaPkES)  First is a dollar for dollar battle.  The current AB Cali with Cerakote shaft and hard chrome sleeves comes out to same price after tax and shipping as the Ohio bar with cerakote shaft.

Now, the Ohio is a 28.5mm shaft, dead smack in the middle of a true 28 WL bar and a 29 power bar.  By design of course.  

The California leaned a bit more to the WL column.  Its still medium whip, medium spin, no center knurl, dual marked bar, but they went with 28mm.

They're both good, both close, but IMO the California is just more thoroughly built, prettier, [feels a bit better, just a bit better executed.](https://imgur.com/uut29ew  

And if you care, AB has their [signature weld style.](https://imgur.com/wOty1pG)

[The knurl is interesting.  It could be described as ""passive"" but there is plenty of grip.](https://imgur.com/Q2reMLA)  Its like AB creates grip more with the design of their knurl pattern than just relying on the roughness.

The cerakote finish feels a bit thinner (in a good way) than the Ohio.  It looks rich and deep in color, it feels more than say, a zinc, but less than the top layer feel of a Rogue's cera.  It almost feels like ""Ecoat+"" if that makes any sense. 

So, lots of people talk about the well built feel of ABs.  They talk about the lack of rattle.  They're dead on.  

[Here's how the AB sounds, with Vulcan Alpha bumpers, on a stone patio.](https://imgur.com/tOzxvHZ) That's rock solid quiet.

So bottom line, SHOULD YOU buy the AB over the Ohio?

Enghhh. Depends.  

Bar for bar, the AB Cali is objectively the nicer bar, BUT its still close enough that I'd say shaft diameter is the tie breaker.  

If you just like a 28mm shaft, take the Cali.  

If you own a dedicated power bar already, take the Cali. (My situation exactly.  I'd ran an Ohio Power and an Ohio as my sort of Batman and Robin and its a great combo, just decide to replace the Ohio.)

If you don't have a preference or don't know your preference AND you only intend to own one do-it-all bar, I'd probably say take the Ohio, since the 28.5 probably makes a more comfortable middle ground for Bench and Squat.

I lost 20 pounds working with [Renaissance Periodization](https://www.instagram.com/rp_transformations/?hl=en) this year. I cut from 200lbs to 180 and am sitting at 185 in a maintenance phase. Working with a nutritionist was a great experience and I highly recommend it. 

It was low stress to follow a plan and have an expert tell you what to do. 

Nutrition is simple, but it’s hard to figure out on your own. It breaks down to how much protein, fat and carbs (your macros) you need each day. Then adjust it based on your goal. If you want to lose weight, you need to be in a caloric deficit, if you want to gain weight, you need to be in a surplus.  

I’m not certified (I’m thinking about it), but I can help you calculate and adjust your macros or recommend a few companies I know are good to work with. I’ve been doing this for a few family members and they’ve seen solid results. 

Below are examples of what I ate in a day while losing weight.

1602268689,"Hi everyone,  
I've had a really weird pain in my upper back (left side) for a few months now, whenever I do muscle ups or pull-ups. I don't think it's anything really serious like a tear, but it's certainly uncomfortable when I reach more extreme ranges of motion in my kip.   
I've never had a muscle knot before, but that's sort of what it feels like having now read some descriptions. I don't feel the pain any other time than kipping, but if I put a tennis ball against the wall and put my arms over my head and roll in the area it hurts, I get a jolt of pain. This is sort of what makes me think it's some kind of muscle knot as it's a VERY concentrated area.  
Has anyone dealt with anything like this before? Because of covid, I'm not massively keen on going to GP/Physio, especially seeing as I can still train pretty much everything except these two kipping movements (strict MU and PU are fine).  
If so, any advice on what I could do to maybe help? :)",crossfit,Weird upper back pain when doing pullups/muscleups/etc (is it a 'knot'?)

1602174808,"For the past 3 years, my girlfriend &amp; I were members at the same box. I recently quit for reasons other than what I’m about to explain. (TL;DR at the bottom)

My girlfriend is still a member at that the box; she Rx’s most workouts. Another female athlete, who is a coach at the box *and* the owner’s girlfriend, is on a similar level, slightly ahead of my gf as she Rx’s everything consistently.

Prior to my departure, this coach had started singling out my girlfriend, not so much during warm-up, but was extra critical during WOD’s, often ignoring other athletes who are less experienced and could use help with their form, etc. (That’s not to say my gf is perfect, no one is, but she isn’t the only one there.)

My girlfriend was bothered by this, but took it in stride. Since I left and haven’t been near her during class, it’s gotten worse. Two weeks ago, while practicing toes-to-bar, this coach (instead of demonstrating herself like the other coaches do) had my gf demonstrate knees-to-chest for scaling, and added, “You should at least know how to do *THESE* by now.” Other members noticed and said something to my gf afterwards.

On another day, prior to a WOD with HSPU, this coach told my gf that she couldn’t use an ab-mat if she wanted to record her time as Rx, but the coach went on to do the workout with an ab-mat to cushion her descent, and still recorded her score as Rx. My gf actually beat this coach for time, but her score is listed in SugarWOD under scaled while the coach’s is under Rx (my gf also did strict and the coach did kipping HSPU).

This morning, the coach was participating as an athlete, not coaching, and during the WOD (which had strict pull-ups) she yelled over to my gf, “Are you even getting your chin over the bar?!” This athlete/coach, based on other members’ reactions and conversations with her usual morning classmates, has never been heard saying these types of things to anyone else. The actual coach for the class today said my gf’s pull-ups looked good.

Now, am I just crazy and biased because it involves my gf, or is this particular coach singling her out and making some pretty condescending remarks? It seems like this other athlete is threatened because of how my girlfriend has progressed to basically the same level. My girlfriend doesn’t want drama and while sometimes she thinks she should say something, she’s also not sure how or if she should because of this other athlete/coach’s relationship with the owner. I’ve known the owner since before I was a member at the box and every time my gf tells me about something that’s happened, it’s hard to keep my mouth shut and not contact the owner myself. But I haven’t because I am trying to respect that it is my girlfriend’s issue to handle how she wants.

TL;DR: An athlete/coach (the box owner’s girlfriend) where my girlfriend goes is singling her out, making condescending remarks about her movements, during workouts, etc. How best to approach the issue? (Should I get involved?)",crossfit,Condescending behavior from a coach
1602173622,"It looks like I'll need to leave my crossfit gym for a while (\*sob\*), so I'm trying to decide what to add to my garage to keep up some level of fitness.  The situation is that I'm pregnant and classes at my gym are moving back inside, which I don't feel comfortable with from a covid risk perspective.  Additionally, I've always figured that once I have a baby in the house, working out at home will probably be more realistic for me, at least for a while.  Therefore, I'm thinking that I should prepare for at least 18 months of home workouts.

I'm debating between setting myself up with a Peleton style set up at home vs a crossfit style set up at home.  I'm interested in opinions from others, especially if they've tried something similar.  **My primary concern is finding something I will stick to - I don't really care what kind of fitness I do as long as I'm doing something to keep healthy and sane.**

Peleton Set Up 

I can get a spin bike for $500-900 and then subscribe to the Peleton app for $12/month (online reviews indicate this hack works great).  Through the Peleton app they have tons of spin classes but also yoga, guided outdoor running, bootcamp type classes, etc.  I think they even have prenatal/post partum yoga classes.  I've been augmenting with this app for a few months now, and it's really well done.

Pros:

 \- Purchase one piece of equipment and you're done

 \- Having someone just tell me what to do through the whole workout really works for me from a motivation/intensity stand point.  I enjoy group fitness and tend to be more successful in that environment.  

 \- Equipment is readily available, no need to wait months for things to come in stock/ship.

 \- I have several friends who do Peleton but live elsewhere, so there is an opportunity to ""meet"" them for a class virtually.

 \- The option for shorter classes seems baby friendly.

Crossfit Set Up

To augment what I already have at home (stall mats, kettle bells, TRX, Bulgarian bag, snow tires that stand in as a plyo box) I'd be looking to add a few sets of hex dumbbells plus a barbell and a few sizes of bumper plates.  I'm having a hard time pinning down what this would cost, but I think it could easily run into the $1500 range?  (If anyone has feedback on this, let me know).  I'd augment with some sort of online programming, maybe Street Parking or Comptrain.  

Pros:

 \- Husband is much more interested in this.

 \- We get to keep lifting and doing crossfit style workouts, which we have enjoyed for many years now.

 \- By choosing our own programming, we could potentially focus more on personal goals rather than just following the class.  (Although while pregnant and post partum my goals are going to be to keep moving while staying safe, so nothing too fancy for me!) 

 \- Offers a lot more variety than just spinning most days which can get boring and for me is sometimes hard on the back.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I know that this is a personal decision, but I thought it would be fun to see if others had insights, opinions, or experience.

I've been trying a lot to find a method that really can improve those things without the need to use extra dumbbell weights

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong. Dumbbell weights are dumbbell weights. You can't replace them

&amp;#x200B;

But when I've started using this product, the differences were seen extremely quickly

&amp;#x200B;

I can't compare it to anything else 

&amp;#x200B;

It gives you a full-body workout at the gym, hotel room, or even in your own home!

&amp;#x200B;

Now you're probably wondering...

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell is it?

&amp;#x200B;

It's a Resistance Belt for Boxing, MMA, or just a sports addict.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, I bought it 3 weeks ago. I am extremely happy with it, it was a lifesaver for me

&amp;#x200B;

Resistance training plays a massive role in every sport:

\- Enhance Speed

\- Gain Explosive Power 

\- Increase Muscle Strength &amp; Conditioning

\- Burn Fat

&amp;#x200B;

You basically put it around your body and you can IMPROVE STRENGTH, ENDURANCE &amp; REFLEXES.

&amp;#x200B;

By resisting your muscles as you contract them, they force those muscles to work harder and grow stronger. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a great way to increase strength using your own body, without the need to use extra dumbbell weights.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I have been helpful to people who have been in my situation!

&amp;#x200B;

1602099219,"I'm a big dude, always have been -- but lately more so.  Probably walked into CrossFit at 300# last September.  Didn't do much on diet at all -- didn't want to do it all at once.  Maybe got to 290# (although clearly more muscle and less fat).  Around February, I finally decided to cut out the beer and immediately dropped another ten.  And ran smack into COVID.  Gym closed, cocktail hour started early.  Back to 295-298#.  Anyway, now that we've been back for a couple of months, I've been going 5-6x a week (pre COVID 4-5) but had sort of stalled at 290#.    


So I decided to get on a nutrition program, counting calories and macros and all that.  Anyway, down 6# in about two weeks and already feeling it.  No beer for 6 days so far (although I do have a little bit of bourbon at night) -- already down to 284# and feeling good.    


Anyway, go me.  


I noticed something which I'm going to use as a milestone of sorts - average of my DL (225) and Back Squat (205) + my current weight (285) = 500.  I'm going to see if I can have those up to 250 average by the time I hit 250#.",crossfit,Go Me.

I normally struggle with depression and see a therapist regularly and take medication for it, but fitness was a huge outlet for managing it. I was also in the best shape of my life, and I was pushing myself hard at the gym because I had a goal to eventually get to competitors level (locally competitive.) I think I was pushing too hard and it may have been a reason I’m where I’m at now, and looking back I am angry at myself and my body for not being able to cope with the training I was doing. I’m bummed out and straight depressed that I’m going to lose what I’ve worked so hard to gain.

I’ve recovered and gotten back to my normal activities though I have to scale on some hanging moves and I’m afraid to try kipping moves. Anyway, every now and again if I try something new or push myself beyond what my shoulder is “used to”- which I try NOT to do, I get this intense achy feeling. It’s not pain like normal joint pain, it’s hard to describe like the foreign parts on my shoulder are re-adjusting or something. I literally start to worry if I broke or stressed the repair.  Then it fades a bit and within 24-48 hours it’s gone and I assume crisis avoided. 

This weekend I was struggling to get back down the rope and kinda fell into basically hanging by my arms and having to gain control. Old me could hang no problem but new me’s shoulder started the strange uncomfortable ache.

Some other members were pushing me saying I should try and beat the top score that day so far at 3.15 because im 2.01m tall and have such an advantage on rowing. I was laughing and saying sure but My previous score was 3.29 so didn't actually believe I was going to get under 3.15. I knew his split time was just above 1.30 for most of the first 500 meters. So I when I noticed I was still rowing 1.27 split most of the time at 500 meters my hart jumped and I realized I could actually do this.  I ended up finishing in 03.07.02 completely destroyed.

1602008701,"Hi, I am a newbie crossfitter, 29M, and looking for your opinion in case of a couple of questions about crossfit, progression and injuries.   
First of all, I feel like my progression is not as good as it should be. I was always a skinny guy, I am 173 cms and was 55kgs when I started Crossfit and now I am 56 kgs. I definitely gained some ""definition"" I mean I changed my body's composition from skinny to slightly athletic since I started (November 2019).  My 1RMs are 75kgs squat, 70kgs deadlift and 35kgs overhead press, but I feel that my cardio performance is improving very slowly. Why? Should I eat more? I know a lots of people who eat one hamburger/day and gain a crazy amount of weight(fat unfortunately). I gain nothing. I eat approximately 2000 cals/day, and I know it's not enough, but....it's sooo hard to learn to cooking.

Second point is injury. Before I started CF I was in the beginning of a recovery process from a severe addiction. It means I didn't do any kind of sports in the past 14 years before Nov. 2019. My mobility is shit. But a lots of people have poor mobility, and don't be injured. But I injured my back from deadlift in the beginning (It was a deep fascia problem according to my physio). When we solved that I injured my left knee by poor squatting technique( probably jumper's knee from patella tendon overuse), we are in the middle of the process to solve that. but in the last two weeks I feel that something is not OK with my elbows. From the viewpoint of symptomology, I feel I developed golfers elbow, tennis elbow and triceps tendonitis also.....so it's crazy. Why am I injured so easily? I try my best about good technique, my coach is a highly educated crossfitter and competitor, he is the training coach of our city's volleyball and handball team. So I don't understand what is happening. I don't want to stop crossfit, I love it, but I feel something needs to be changed, if I want to do it for my health and happiness. What do you think?

1601769168,"Hi All,

I've found that if I increase cardio duration (not intensity) too much, my body begins to favor cardio conditioning over strength conditioning and hypertrophy. I've experienced this in the past that whenever increase cardio too much it's as if my body flicks a switch and burns muscle (it sees muscle as a cardiovascular liability instead of an asset). At the moment I do each of the following once a week on the Echo bike:

1. 4 Mins: 20s/10s HIIT (8 cycles - 4 mins)
2. 10 Mins: 60s/60s Interval (5 cycles - 10 mins)
3. 5 Mins: 5min Steady State (cycling only, no arms, same pace - 5 mins) 85-90% MHR (this is a 5-minute warm-up for legs day)
4. 10 Mins: 10min Steady State (same pace - 10 mins) - 75-85% MHR
5. 20 Mins: 60s/60s Interval (10 cycles - 20 mins)

Total dedicated cardio and metabolic conditioning on the bike is about 45 mins per week. My performance and capacity continues to increase and I find the above to be the sweet spot for me, but I still want to get feedback on if this is enough in the long-term to stay in top metabolic shape? 

I lift weights 4 times per week:

* 3 days are high intensity (heavy weight, 6-10 reps, 24-30 sets/workout, compound and isolation exercises)
* 1 day is full body (moderate weight, 12-15 reps, 24-30, primarily compound).

I've also noticed that the Echo bike is far more taxing than using a treadmill, stationary bike or cross trainer.

Also, I see with some of the programs such as Engine Builder ( [u/TheGainsLab](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheGainsLab/) ) prescribe much more cardio than the above.

Is he providing the right solution? Every post I have read has had people staying in the hospital for 3-5 days to get their levels back to normal or semi-normal ranges.

1601594339,"Because of an injury I've explored a variety of CF alternative classes... the cycle's, F45's, Orange Theory's and general 'bootcampish' gyms.

The workout's were generally solid and definitely build an engine BUT I found that the sense of 'community' just wasn't at the same level as a CF box. It was there, but didn't seem to be as tight as a CF Box.

The difference is in the typical 3 part approach. With CF after the warmup you move to strength/skill. At this point you setup and have an opportunity to chat about what weight you're gonna try, or whatever.

After that part's done you cleanup &amp; setup for the WOD... another chance to talk about the new PR you just hit or how much you hate burpees in the upcoming WOD etc. These are two recurring bond-forming opportunities that aren't as prevalent in other instructor-led fitness classes which are more 'go-go-go' from start to finish.

I've been considering pausing my CF membership and joining a regular gym (they have rowers and an assault bike) in order to fully commit to the Engine Builder. 

I usually do afternoon classes (METCONs) after which I do the YoE. Accompanied by work, this has become too much. I also feel too rushed as I need to still make supper, do chores, and spend time with my GF. After starting YoE, I made it to week 3 after which I crashed. 

The reason I'm posting is, alongside YoE I want to continue strength training and make some gains. I'll eventually return to the box and hope to be stronger and fitter and better at Metcons, especially eyeing the Open next year. Three guys at our box finished top 5 in my country in scaled, and I've been playing catch-up to them. Hoping to finish top 3 next year (just a personal goal). 

Any good, free programs to use for strength and some gymnastics? Everyday will start with YoE, afterwhich I can do strength and some skills. I also plan on doing the 'Russian Fighter Pull-up Program' and a lot of core work (Kari Pearce).

I love the community aspect and working out with a group who pushes each other to do their best. Everyone at the gym has been really friendly and welcoming from day one although I think lately my own insecurities and mental blocks get in the way socially and with my progress. 

I tend to still get encouragement and a push from the coaches during WODs and some days I’m able to get through the WOD and feel good about what I’ve done, other days my head gets in the way and everything goes out the window. My own worst enemy is myself and I hold myself back.

So, sometimes and maybe it’s just me self projecting but I feel like some of the other members notice or feel that I need the push and find it annoying or disruptive. Or that I haven’t grown out of a beginner phase. I’m not sure. Or maybe it’s just that I tend to be a bit quiet but I’ve always been friendly and I respect everyone at the gym and all the coaches a ton.

Went to the hospital, met a specialist, told me to slow down and come back in two-three weeks to see where's what. It's a partially torn bicep and some muscle strain. 
Got my followup rendez-vous and was cleared to start using lightweight and bands to strengthen my arm, shoulder and everything around. Since I can move it well, push and pull, it's only when I rotate or get overhead that it pinches.

A few days ago it was announced in Paris and its surrounding suburbs and the Bordeaux, Lille, Toulouse, Lyon, Saint-Étienne, Rouen, Grenoble, Rennes, and Montpellier metropole areas all ""salles de sport"" so fitness centers, gyms, CrossFit gyms, etc must shut for a period of 2 weeks which can be renewed.

As a CrossFit member at a gym in Paris, this sucks. We've had NO cases from my gym to my knowledge (we would have been alerted if there had been). We are 3-4m at a distance at minimum, clean our entire area after workouts and all the machines/plates/walls/bars/etc we touch, wear masks, and are under 10 people a class. Our gym spent who knows how much money re-arranging the inside (including buying a few new rigs) to allow for the new floor plan to accommodate the social distancing arrangements. Our coaches work tirelessly to ensure safety. 

My gym has written to our neighborhoods town hall (each arrondissement in Paris has their own if you aren't familiar) and to the prefect and mayor's offices. We've signed petitions. It just seems pretty glum. We were able to bounce back from last time but facing this one more time seems impossible.

While obviously I'm sad because I can't workout with all the equipment I love, I am mostly sad for the box owner, who is obviously under financial stress, and for the coaches. Most coaches in France are considered ""self-employed"" so they do not qualify for the same unemployment benefits, if any (I myself am not French so I don't exactly know the full breakdown but I do know that is true). I'm also frustrated because every member takes strict, strict precautions and yet I see groups of 30-40 people drinking at bars or in parks, unmasked and 2 inches away from one another and the police walk by without saying a *thing* to them.

1601026600,"Today one of the most sought after effects in the fitness and health sector is fat loss, we are going to provide you with a protocol consisting of training, supplementation and diet focused on fat loss and that its validity has been proven, this protocol is very effective and should be used to finish a cutting phase after hitting a plateau or if you have a high fat percentage and want to start losing fat effectively, this protocol is nothing new, at least the parts that compose it, but it works very well together and I think that some of you would find it very useful.

&amp;#x200B;

Training

We are going to focus on a metabolic type training for two reasons, it is an intense training that consumes a lot of Kcal and increases our metabolic rate in the short term, I would do this type of training 2 to 3 times a week and the rest of our training days follow your normal workout routine.

A metabolic training is usually composed of compound exercises with very little rest between them, the training will consist of Supersets (groups of different exercises) of which we will perform 2-3 sets of 10-13 reps resting between 30 to 40 secs: 1 (Barbell Squats, Standing Dumbbell Shoulder Press), 2 (Standard Lunges, Incline Dumbbell Bench Press), 3 (Single Arm Dumbbell Rows, V Ups).

I would also recommend doing 30 minutes of cardio at a steady pace after finishing your workout.

&amp;#x200B;

Diet

We are going to do a PSMF diet, it is a diet really high in protein and low in calories.

If we have less than 15% fat (M) or 24% (W) we will consume 2.5-3/p x kg of LBM on metabolic training days and 3.5-4g on weight training days, and 2,5/p per kg of LBM on resting days, we will follow the diet for 11 days and we will carry out a carbohydrate load 3 days in a row after finishing it.

If you have a higher fat percentage (16-25% (M) or 25-34% (W)), the protein will be 2,2/p per kg of LBM on metabolic training days and 2,5/p per kg of LBM on weight training days, on resting days 2g per kg of LBM, the athletes in this category can have a cheat meal each week and do a carb load once a week for 3-6 weeks.

Males with bf higher tham 26% or woman with bf higher than 35% should consume 1.8/p per kg of LBM on metabolic training days, 2 gr on weight training days and 1.5 on resting days, athletes should follow this diet for 8-12 weeks and have two cheat meals per week.

Carbs and fats will only be consumed in trace form.

&amp;#x200B;

Supplementation

Caffeine: stimulates the NS, increases energy expenditure and the transport of fats and their oxidation.

EGCG: increases energy expenditure and lipid oxidation.

P-synephrine: increases metabolism, lipolysis and thermogenesis.

I would recommend taking them at a dosage of 200mg caffeine (or more) + 10mg Synephrine + 500mg EGCG, 30 minutes before training.",crossfit,The modern approach: fat burning protocol 2020

I've been doing CF for 3 years, primarily going to a box, but I had a small home gym which turned into a pretty complete gym (bar, plates, dumbbells, kettlebells, pullup bar) thanks to Covid. I've been browsing around online at online programming (comptrain, mayhem, OpenGym, Linchpin, etc) for two reasons: 1) My wife is pregnant, due in February, and I know in the coming months (and even more so once the baby comes) that my ability to work out will revolve around when I can find the time to squeeze something in, and not about my box's scheduled class times. 2) With the pregnancy we're being extra cautious about covid. The box I go to now is doing indoor and outdoor workouts, so i've been limiting my attendance to outdoor workouts. But in the coming weeks here in Massachusetts its going to get cold, and they'll inevitably go 100% indoors, at which point I'm not sure if I'll keep going. Not to mention if there really is a second wave, gyms will probably be one of the first things Massachusetts closes again.

So ideally what I'm looking for is a program where the base workout is in the ""under 60 minute"" range and utilizes a good range of equipment, but then also comes with options for accessory work or Oly/Strength work to add on.

I found my capacity for AMRAPs or endurance workouts (like Murph) very limited even after over a year of regular Crossfit sessions. I could crush high strength in short bursts (like Fran), but too many wall balls, burpees, pull ups, high rep barbell movements would destroy me.

The solution I have found that works was the most simple solution that you all gave me. I have noticed considerable improvement in a matter of weeks. Lose fat and scale WODs.

Some fat loss from ~18% to about ~14% helped a lot. Keto diet and 1700 calories per day cut that in a matter of 5-6 weeks, about 20lbs. My goal is 10%, I think that would be ideal.

Also, I dropped the ego and I stopped trying so hard to do Rx weight. I just decided I was gonna scale down so I could commit an even, challenging pace for the whole WOD. I am also way less sore now, and much more consistent with working out 3 days on, 1 off. It’s more enjoyable this way too.

1600904416,"Hello everyone! I have taken a few private CrossFit classes and learned the different functional movements for workouts. The only issue now is that I still don’t understand the terminology. 

For the following workouts, could someone please explain what the EMOM/AMRAP/METCON/other instructions are directing me to complete? Thank you so much!

**Example 1:**

(What do the AMRAP/EMOM mean here?)

AMRAP x 10 MINUTES
200m Run
AMRAP x 1 MINUTE: 3 Strict Pull-up or 5 Ring Rows + 5 Up downs + 10 Air Squats
Workout
Metcon (No Measure)
EMOM x 18 MINUTES
MIN 1 - :50 Bike or Row
MIN 2 - 15 Slam Balls then Plank Hold Remainder of Minute
MIN 3 - 10 Ring Rows then Hollow Hold Remainder of Minute

**Example 2:** 

(Within this one, what does it mean by every 4:00 for 5 sets? Does this just indicate that I complete the listed workout, take the remaining time as rest, and then continue onto next set when 4 minutes ends?)


Metcon (Time)
EVERY 4:00 x 5 SETS
15 Hang Power Cleans (75/53)
12 Front Squats
9 Handstand Push-ups or Seated DB Shoulder Press (35/20)

**Example 3:**

(Does “3 rounds for time” just indicate completing 3 rounds as fast as possible?)


Metcon (Time)
3 ROUNDS FOR TIME
30/20 Cal Row
15 Deadlifts (185/123)
12 Handstand Push-Ups or DB Shoulder Press (50's/35's)

1600882644," There are three main types of mobility that are necessary for pistols…

#### (1) Ankle Dorsiflexion

Lots of athletes have a terrible time keeping their heels grounded while doing pistols.  Even many high level athlete have a tough time.  This is rarely an issue solely with the ankle joint, but likely they do have some limitations there as well.  Here is a quick test to see if you do, in fact, have an ankle mobility limitation…

&gt;*Why does the pistol demand so much more of your ankle mobility than an air squat?”*

Well, in an air squat, you can spread your feet to shoulder width and use your hip mobility much more, which allows less of the ground to be made up at your ankles.

Noah Ohlsen is an athlete who takes full advantage of his hip mobility while bilateral squatting.  You can see [**in this video**](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-K16Ndh637/) that his knees never track that far forward in the bottom of his squat.  Compare that to the [**video of this Weightlifter snatching**](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_sEi91gqPW/), who clearly uses a substantial amount of forward knee travel and ankle mobility.

So, in short, you can’t escape poor ankle mobility in the pistol by disguising it with your stance width and hip range of motion.

This is a concept I explain in this video… [Mastering Pistols for Tall Athletes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiW5dVqYSGg&amp;feature=emb_title)

**(2) Hip Flexion &amp; Core Compression**

While the ankle does contribute significantly to the challenge of the pistol, the hip has equal demands, just in ways that aren’t commonly required for other squatting movements.

The hip flexors and quads must be strong at near end range, but the mobility requirement is actually on the other side of those joints: the muscle groups put on stretch.  Deep hip flexion while folding the body requires flexibility in the posterior chain so that the muscles on the anterior (front of the body) don’t have to work so hard to overcome this tension.  

#### (3) Hip Adduction &amp; Internal Rotation

Another thing to consider is how much closer the femurs are to the midline of your body throughout the pistol versus a squat.  This is a fundamental difference between a bilateral (2-sided) movement like a squat, and a unilateral (1-sided) movement.

In the Pistol you are standing on one leg, so to maintain balance you must have that one point of contact directly under your center of mass.  

This isn’t a big deal when you’re standing, but as you descend in the squat your femur *must* come towards the midline of your body (adduction).  And to maintain a vertical shin (avoiding **valgus knee**) you *must* internally rotate the femur at the hip.

You can see this motion clearly from Colleen Fotsch’s pistols in the fourth video [**in this post**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CD5KzHFgf60/).

This is a unique combination of ranges that -frankly- most athletes don’t have.

It's a concept I explain more in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIufiJrolgk).

&amp;#x200B;

Feel feel to ask questions, I'd be happy to help clarify.

Looked at the 2016-2019 games with the new scoring and it seems Tia might not be as safe as it seems in 2020. In the 2017 and 2018 games, with only 4 athletes (data on Haley Adams not available), Katrin would have won if placements stay the same with the new scoring system.

An example how this might turn out: Katrin gets 2nd in any of the Cardio events with Tia getting 1st. However, in anything involving gymnastics, Tia might get last because Kari/Brooke/Katrin all have gymnastics backgrounds. Not enough people to middle between Tia/Katrin in cardio events but 2 people to middle between Katrin/Tia in gymnastic events. Similarly, Tia is way above Katrin in strength, but only Brooke has a good chance of middling between them.

Obviously Tia has gotten a lot better over the years and is still a huge favorite, but only 5 competitors can definitely change the results.",crossfit,2016-2019 Crossfit Games with smaller field and 2020 scoring

1600562619,"Sorry up front for this lengthy question. I’m new to CrossFit... not in very good shape, and 37 yrs old. I used to be reasonably athletic, and probably to the average person, with me wearing a baggy shirt, they likely would overestimate my current athletic ability. 

I joined my local box a couple months back admittedly after seeing The Redeemed and the Dominant. I have been really inspired by the CrossFit community, and enjoy the style of workouts. 

My issue is this... I feel like I’m really not getting much in the way of coaching, or even suggested scaling from my box and it’s becoming a bit discouraging. I have no plans on quitting CrossFit, but I’m trying to figure out if I’d be better off just investing the money I’m currently putting into monthly dues, towards home equipment, and then once I build up my fitness rejoining a box.... at this point I feel like I’m not learning much about the fundamentals of Olympic lifting, and I’m struggling to even finish each workout. 
For whatever reason I feel like my coaches are just assuming I know how to snatch, clean, etc. even though I most definitely don’t.

just a quick question. Been having the nano 5 for about 3,5 years now and just bought the Nano X. Same size (43).

Today I did the first class in the box with the new shoes. 

The Nano X seem quite tight in the toe box, just a little bit too tight. So they were not comfortable. On the other hand I had more support and more ""feeling"" with the shoes and hit some good snatches. So lifting felt good, but not comfortable... Its hard to explain. Somewhat like climbing shoes...

So my question is, did you feel the same? Should I change the size one up (43.5 is not available, next size 44...) or will they widen up? On the other hand, I am wearing them just for one hour a day...

This year everything is working a little differently. Each day will be split into 2 blocks during which the athletes will have time to perform 2 workouts. They will have only one chance at each workout, and there will be no restarts and no re-dos. At the end of the weekend the top 5 athletes in the men's and women's division will earn a berth for the Finals occurring October 19-25.

**Saturday:**

Block 3: 9AM-12PM

Block 4: 12PM-3PM

At the end of each block in the Pacific time zone, scores will start to flow in and CrossFit will have an update show featuring athletes videos, and analysis of the leaderboard.

1600442506,"Hey all! Been Crossfitting for a little more than two years, 33 year-old male, 5’6” and around 165-170 lbs, and I usually go 6 days a week. We just tested Karen today, and I did terrible at 12:26 Rx. My shoulders were just beyond fried at the end, and needless to say I finished last.

I’m quite disappointed with that performance. I was aiming for around 8 minutes, but after 50 wall balls I knew that wasn’t happening. I figured that after doing this for more than two years I should have gotten a much better time, especially when comparing my times to others who have been crossfitting a similar amount of time. What can I do to get better? I also make sure, that since wall balls are my weakness, I frequently do wods with them at open gym, so I am trying.

I do admit, there are factors that I think influenced my poor time (today is my day off from work so I did an early morning class whereas I usually do afternoons, I’m nursing a torn callus and I feel a bit banged up from the past two wods we did,) but I think even considering that, I should have done better.",crossfit,Disappointed in my Karen time.

Welcome to the beginning of the CrossFit Games for the 2020 season! It's been a wild year in CrossFit with changes in management, canceled events, and a whole new format, but here we are. Get ready for 2 days of athletes pushing themselves to their max in order to try and grab one of the coveted 5 spots at the ranch in Aromas, California.
_______________________________________
This year everything is working a little differently. Each day will be split into 2 blocks during which the athletes will have time to perform 2 workouts. They will have only one chance at each workout, and there will be no restarts and no re-dos. At the end of the weekend the top 5 athletes in the men's and women's division will earn a berth for the Finals occurring October 19-25.

**Friday:**

Block 1: 9AM-12PM

Block 2: 3PM-6PM

**Saturday:**

Block 3: 9AM-12PM

Block 4: 12PM-3PM

At the end of each block in the Pacific time zone, scores will start to flow in and CrossFit will have an update show featuring athletes videos, and analysis of the leaderboard.

I want to keep lifting heavy, but I am concerned about imbalances, especially as I am currently focusing on my back to try and solve front/back imbalances that led to shoulder issues.

1600335469,"I’ve been working out with various intensities for about three years now after losing a whole lot of weight and focusing on my fitness. I really got into running, but haven’t been able to get my runs in recently. 

I also do weight lifting / bodybuilding with a focus on strength training and muscle size around 3-4 times a week. But recently I’ve been feeling bored by the repetitive nature of strength training and have noticed that I’ve been putting on a bit of fat (along with the muscle) and have been wanting to experiment with CrossFit. My body fat percentage is 22% (not good, I know, but I was at about 30% only three years ago) and I seriously want it to drop below 20%. 

I have a fairly good home gym and don’t want to sign up to classes, and have been studying up on CrossFit hoping to add some of the elements of CrossFit to my workout routine, or at least to do straight up CrossFit a few days a week in addition to my normal routine. I’ve always enjoyed HIIT workouts. 

My thinking is that I can build my workouts as such:

~Warmup 10 Mins
~CrossFit WoD 15-25 Mins
~Strength Training 30-45 Mins
~Cool Down 5 Mins

Is this a good idea? And if so what would you recommend I take into account?

1600266453,"Just curious.  My squat clean has never been very high and I would like to work on it.  I say not high.. I mean relative to my other strengths.  I'm 5'8, male, and 205 lbs.  I can clean 205 all day long.  Sometimes I can do 225, and on a really good day, with a good lift I've hit 255.  I can front squat 255 all day long for reps.  So I feel like if I can get under the bar faster I should be able to clean allot more.  

My question is, how relevant is your deadlift / front squat strength to your clean?  I ask this because when I try to pull more than 225 off of the ground for that first pull it seems impossible to get it moving fast enough or high enough for me to get under the bar.  I see others my size and weight, or smaller, successfully lifting 300 lbs like it's nothing.  Are these guys able to deadlift near 500 lbs to be able to get 300 lbs moving that fast?

For reference my front squat is 315, back squat 395 and deadlift 385.  Do those numbers have anything to do with it?  Theoretically I should be able to clean 315, right?  If I could only figure out how to get the bar and my body moving fast enough.

What I'm really trying to do is figure out where my deficit is and where I need to focus my efforts.  Clearly technique is an issue, but is overall strength an issue as well?

The context is that I have moved from a small flat to a small house and therefore been excited about all of the additional space. Myself and my partner now have a spare room and garden, one of which I was hoping I would be able to store some of my gym equipment. 

Now that we have moved I’ve realised that while the space is nice it still isn’t likely big enough for large machines (although will have space for barbell etc).

The current options I see myself with are:
1) only buy one machine (likely rower) and hope that my partner doesn’t mind too much about having an ‘eyesore’ visible in the house at all times.

2) come up with some creative way to take down and store the equipment after each workout (hopefully limiting the time taken to do this as to not put me off big cardio workouts)

3) store the machines in the garden - my only worry here is them getting damaged quickly (any tips or tricks appreciated)

I’m pretty average at CrossFit. Rowing and running are my strengths and I’m solid at the body weight movements. Gymnastics stuff is fun and I’m working on getting my strict pull-ups post covid closure. Eventually I wanna get muscle ups and handstand push-ups.

I crushed 2 discs in my lower back almost 10 years ago. I have had two back surgeries to repair it but last year I jumped off a wall and landed wrong and fractured a vertebra and herniated a disc. It hurts daily but nothing that’ll stop me from working out. The Dr said it’s stable and I can lift within reason.

Thanks for the read friends! I need some insight from the community, your opinions are welcomed and encouraged.

I am a 30 year old male who has been doing Crossfit for over a year. I go 3 days on, 1 day off with almost perfect consistency. I have been an athlete of various sports my whole life.

My engine just does not have the same output as the others around me. I usually score fewer rounds on the board than everybody in the class for AMRAPs. I scale weights down on AMRAPS to try and get a consistent work load and complete the workout feeling 85% - 95% physically spent.

I perform considerably above average on EMOMs, strength workouts, Oly lifts, power lifts. Anything that gives me frequent periods of rest.

I am 5’11”, 210lbs, 14% bodyfat. I naturally have larger and more compact muscles, big quads/glutes/shoulders.

Is anyone out there built like me that has this issue? Is it our genetics that just favour being large and powerful, instead of lean and agile? Will I overcome this weak engine problem if I just keep going to Crossfit, or do I need to change something?

I have considered eating less and slimming down to 185lbs to see if it helps but that is close to my total fat-free body mass, I don’t even know if it’s possible!",crossfit,"15 months in, I feel my “engine” is below average... am I alone?"

Here are the facts:
1)Currently following Marcus Filly‘s Persist program with about 3-4 sessions per week
2)In addition I do 1-2 regular CrossFit classes at my box
3) I own a skierg but Persist program often prescribes a bike for the workouts. There are no long stints in the workouts but rather short ones like „5 rounds of 10 secs at 97%“ or „500m @80%“ and so on

So, I was pretty much sold on the echo bike but after some more research I am not so sure any more. 

It’s just a fact that a lot of people on YouTube etc. currently recommend the C2 bikeerg. 
Knowing C2 they are really reliable machines and fun to use. Plus, the bikeerg is considerably lighter and since I need to move my equipment around a bit when setting up for my workout, that’s another plus for the bikeerg. The echo bike in contrast seems to be more bulky and way heavier. 

What I am a bit unsure about is, whether the bikeerg is suited for the type of workouts I do or if it is more suited for regular / longer cardio sessions (which I hardly do at all at this point)🤔
Also, what’s a bit of a bummer is that it is an additional 200€ over the echo bike (here in Europe) and its not in stock at this point with no info when it will be available again. 

So: bikeerg or echo bike?
Does anyone own/use both of them and recommend one over the other?
Would the bikeerg be suitable for the type of workouts I do (meaning: is it that versatile of a machine or not really)?

* You have only one competitor during the training: Your past self. Performance of others is irrelevant
* Your coach is here for you. Always better to ""ask stupid question"" than not ask at all and hurting self because you misunderstood self

I spent the next two years of residency cycling to work, doing an occasional hike, and battling against my work schedule to get any type of regular gym time at the local Y. 

I did my first squat cycle and hit a new PR, improved my power clean technique, got some thicc thighs from biking and an occasional spin class, and actually went for a run once or twice (hate running).

After finishing residency and getting a job I joined a local CF gym and remembered what I’d been missing. I had to relearn Kipping pull ups, hspu, and some other weird skills I hadn’t kept up. My cardio sucked but I was pulling some major (for me) weight on deadlifts, cleans, and squats. And I actually kept up with cycling and got into mountain biking lately. 

I just wanted to encourage everyone out there who is unable to make it to their box for many valid reasons right now. I was really disappointed with my situation but it turned out to be a good break for me and prevented me from getting stagnant. I also won’t lie-those 2 years were a major struggle to get any consistent exercise aside from the short bike ride to work. 

If you’ve been forced into a CF hiatus, hang in there. It took me a while to move onto something else bc I was bummed about my situation. Don’t be like me!

Although not technically correct (by weightlifting standard) our athlete in Clip 2 still adheres to all the current CF competition standards by simply ""reverse curling"" the bar into the front rack position while already in a squat, thus increasing the cycling speed.  


It is important to practice both ways during training, in order to be flexible when speed matters. (Also note brushing the bar against quads on the way down in Clip 1 for more control and no contact in Clip 2). ""

1599700202,"I’ve (28m) been doing CrossFit for a little over 3 years. It’s been great so far. Coaches are cool, fellow athletes are cool, some workouts are better than others. 

Despite my 3 years of experience, I’m still working on a lot of things, especially conditioning and endurance during the longer metcons. I consistently have been the last (if not the one of the last) person to finish during metcons. I’ve hit many time caps and have DNF’d my fair share of them. 

I try to focus on the fact that at the end of the day I’ve got a good workout in and I was productive. However, there are times where it bothers me that I’m almost always the last to finish, when people around me make it look so easy. 

Now, during all of this it ends up being me still huffing and puffing my way through a workout while everyone else in the class starts cheering me on and praising me. “C’mon man you can do it!” “Keep going bro” “Nice man, don’t drop that bar!” “What number are you on man?! Only a few reps left!” “Give me at least 5 more man you got it!”  Of course I’m very much sure all of these people are being nice and are actually trying to be supportive. But deep down it irks me for some reason. 

Before CrossFit I’ve always worked out alone, never really felt the need of having a companion during my workouts. Just went to the gym, did my thing, and left. I had my own reasons to keep motivated. 

I’m not afraid to admit that perhaps it’s my own insecurity. When I’m the last one still working out and all of those people start cheering it makes me feel...like I’m bad at working out? It’s like cheap patronizing. I almost feel like it’s forced, and these people are being fake. Again, I’m sure that’s not the case, but while I’m damn near dying with 50 burpees to go, I’d rather get myself into the zone and block everything out.

And I don’t have the heart to ask them to stop because I’ll feel like an asshole for sure.",crossfit,Possibly an unpopular opinion: I’m not a huge fan of being cheered on and praised during MetCons

I started CrossFit at this gym about 4.5 years ago. I was overweight and did not exercise. I think I had early signs of sleep apnea, slightly high blood pressure, and was probably pre-diabetic. I think I about died on my assessment workout, but liked the workouts and the environment and kept coming back. Along with diet, I eventually lost 50 pounds and would say that I'm likely in the best shape of my life.

Like I said, our gym is small: we only have between 5 and 8 people per class, and at this point, only really have two classes per day. The owners are effectively the only coaches. It's not the nicest (or cleanest) gym in town, but it has felt like a family and I'm definitely going to miss it and the people there.

The owners are going to be selling the equipment to us and after having good success working out at home during the COVID lockdown, I've decided to purchase some and go all-in on the home gym thing. I'm looking forward to doing my own programming and being able to do different types of workouts and focus on the things that I want (and knowing that I won't have to make myself do wallballs or thrusters).

20 Thrusters
20 Push Press

20 Overhead Squats

I can either use the training bar with 10lb plates- which equals 35lbs. Or I can use the women’s bar which is a total of 35lbs alone. (I am a girl and I feel like the women’s bar is more comfortable). 

In your opinion, is it more beneficial to use the bar alone which is more comfortable in my hands? Or is it better to use the training bar so I can have actual plates on it? They both equal the same but I’m not sure if having plates makes a difference or not?

I am sure everyone knows what it is, but for those who don't, it is

1600m Run
100 Pull ups
200 Pushups
300 Squats
1600m Run

(With a 20 pound vest on) 

I have been crossfitting for 3 months now, and I never thought in my wildest dreams I could ever do anything like this.

It was a scaled version where instead of pull-up (can't do them yet and we were not allowed boxed this time around) I had to do American Swings with a 16kg Kettlebell and no vest of course. The rest stayed the same and I did it in 54:45.

The pain and the fatigue and all the mental blocks that one has to power through to finish this is immense. And respect to anyone who did this workout recently or ever! 

Next year the aim is to do it with proper pull ups and hopefully beat this time.

I'm not going to pretend to know the inner workings of the shoulder, and it's going to be a bit till I get into an ortho.

Covid has me spooked to go back to my Crossfit gym, so now I'm finally getting the push to set up a small gym in my garage. I'm a 5' female and never got around to lifting more than my body weight (\~115#). There's a ton of backorders/out-of-stock on most equipment now and the used market is sparse in my area, so I'm having to compromise a bit in building the gym. Is this is good enough to get a good workout with the basic lifts and protect my garage/concrete floor?

1. Fringe Sport kid's squat rack
2. Titan Fitness 60"" Olympic Bar (25#)
3. TrafficMASTER Rubber Gym/Weight Room floor tiles
4. Giant Lifting bumper plates -- 10#, 15#, and 25# pairs

Since I won't be throwing a ton of weight around and typically don't drop my weights anyways, should I still make a platform? Is there anything else I need or should swap out?",crossfit,Garage gym for light lifter question

1599178269,"I do CrossFit 5 days a week, 1 hour a day, from 5 to 6 p.m. This entails, on average, 12 minutes of strength work followed by 22 minutes of metcon. One caveat is that since the beggining of June, we've been doing much less strength work, due to weight limitations as a result of the pandemic. Before the pandemic, my lift numbers were all steadily rising, but my muscles had only been growing slightly, and I hadn't been losing fat. Back then I was eating around 3500 calories, which probably explains the lack of fat loss.

I'm a 22-year-old male, 5'9, 170 lb., around 20% body fat.

I sleep 9 hours a night, from around 3 a.m. to 12 p.m., which I'm working on shifting earlier gradually.

My TDEE is 2500 calories, and my diet averages daily to 2550 calories, 172g protein, 67g fat, and 278g carbs (more specifically, on my 5 workout days during the week I eat 2500 calories, 200g protein, 55g fat, and 300g carbs, and on my 2 weekend days I eat 2680 calories, 103g protein, 97g fat, and 226g carbs - not perfect, but not often, and look at the average above).

I split my calories and macros evenly among a protein shake and 3 meals, the first of which I eat usually within an hour of waking up, and finish eating around 3 hours before I start working out (otherwise I feel it in my stomach). I then drink the protein shake within an hour after working out, then lunch around 1.5 hours after that, then dinner 2.5-3 hours after that. I finish dinner about an hour before getting in bed, and then it takes me a while to fall asleep, but I sleep very well.

My goals are to be probably around the same weight I am now, but around 10% body fat, which will mean putting on more muscle. I've done probably 50+ hours of research on all things fitness/nutrition, and am doing everything I can to reach my goals, or so I thought, given the research.

TL;DR: I'm 22, male, 5'9, 170 lb., 20% body fat, looking to build muscle and burn fat to reach 10% bodyfat at my same weight. I sleep 9 hours (slightly later than normal), eat 2550 calories, 172g protein, 67g fat, and 278g carbs, and do CrossFit 5 days a week (12 minutes strength followed by 22 minutes metcon). Am I doing something wrong?

P.S. I know I'll get comments saying ""this forum is for CrossFit, not bodybuilding,"" to which I reply, I get it, but CrossFit is my lifestyle; I love it to death, and think of me as a CrossFitter who wants to look as good as I perform, not a bodybuilder posting in the wrong forum.

1599170241,"I’ve been doing CrossFit at a local box for about a year and a half now and am beginning to wonder if how I feel after a WOD is normal. I seem to always feel beyond exhausted, lying on the floor taking a few minutes to catch my breath and my entire body feeling like it’s had the life drained from it. Once I do catch my breath and get up, I feel like falling asleep usually for the next hour or 2, my face is flush, and my muscles feel shaky. 

On the surface, I feel like most people say “that just means you pushed yourself hard” but when I compare myself to others at my gym, they appear recovered long before me and even have a better score than me. I feel like I’m the only one suffering despite having the slowest time/lowest score. It’s even more frustrating when newcomers begin outperforming me after a few months of training. 

I’m 35 years old, 6’3 and about 190lbs and like to think I have a thin/athletic build. I’m by no means a nutrition master, but like to think I eat cleaner/better than your average person (balanced meals with snacks in between like fruit, nuts, protein bars, etc). I’ve had blood drawn for physical exams within the last couple of years and everything came back normal.

After I figured out how to do that thought id try muscle ups. I could do 3 strict pull ups when i started and using 3 bands 1 muscle up after a couple of weeks. Slowly practiced the pull ups and reduced the bands till finally after about 2-3 months hit this unassisted. Have managed a good few reps (not linked) every gym session since. Still cant kip haha.

1598994964,"Some background--I've (30F) jumped down the CrossFit rabbit hole over the last year and am absolutely hooked. I love watching the games athletes for motivation to keep pushing myself, but (and as a recognized personal bias, a professional marketer by day and a bit skeptical of most things) I try not to take everything at face value for truth. 

Now I do not have a goal to compete at the games, but being able to Rx most workouts and do things I've never done before (gymnastics moves in particular) is definitely on my goals list. And, I have a competitive spirit--being able to compete in beginners events or non-elite local box events and not finish dead last would definitely be on my shortlist of goals. (I was a pretty dedicated athlete in high school but burned out and turned down all of my scholarship offers; wouldn't call myself much of an athlete since, FWIW, but CF has definitely sparked that physical expression and competitiveness in me that I have been restricting for the last 8-9 years). 

Here comes a second blind spot of mine that I am going to openly admit--I am relatively naive and grew up in a family who told me I could be/do anything I want to be. Age and experience has taught me otherwise, but is it healthy to look to games athletes as a guiding motivational compass towards my goals, or am I just a victim of influencer marketing? Can I possibly reach any sort of Rx/notable PR's without PEDs, three coaches, and a nutritional plan around 3,000 calories a day to support a required 3 workouts a day that I would have to do to even come close to Rxing anything? Are elite athletes commonly cycling PEDs across the board (I realize I probably won't get an answer here, which is fair) and I need to just accept that, or is a vast majority ""natural""? Are we just starting to see the target on CF's back because of jealousy and the tendency for the world to try to belittle any and everything/one that they can behind a monitor and keyboard by saying that what elite athletes of CF accomplish is unnatural/impossible/rigged in some way?

I don't want to call any particular games athlete out, but there are quite a few that inspire me on a regular basis, some of which are regular posters on this sub. Maybe I am just naively looking to grasp at straws and find some sort of semblance of good in this world and refuse to accept that most games athletes and this sport is turning into a roided out community that it is impossible for mere mortals such as myself can be a part of, or maybe my blind naivety and relentless optimism is shadowing the truth...?

TL;DR: someone shoot me straight here: am I falling victim to the rose-colored glasses that is marketing and social media, or is RXing movements for ""laypersons"" actually still possible with good nutrition and consistency without PEDs, a ""pay-to-play"" strategy, or a dedicated team of coaches programming for you 3 workouts a day?",crossfit,"Am I falling victim to the rose-colored glasses that is marketing and social media, or is RXing movements for ""laypersons"" actually still possible with good nutrition and consistency?"

1598744351,"Hello everyone, :)

Curious if anyone experiences severe abdominal swelling during and after crossfit sessions, and, during any physical exertion. Many years ago while cycling by myself, I felt something heavy in the area between my sternum and navel. I was not doing anything strenuous like intervals or race pace training. The heaviness made physical efforts a bit harder and I could not belly breath as deeply because something felt ""in the way"" in that area. During this time my body weight increased by 15 pounds within a month with no changes to diet, sleep or exercise. Over the years, the swelling would get more pronounced, especially after every bowel movement and any amount of exercise, even 10 minutes. Body weight continued to gradually increase (have more overall puffiness rather than being lean like before).

It has reached the point that I had to stop crossfit sessions and other aerobic exercise because my abdomen would get swollen like a lady four to six months pregnant. I've had many labs and tests and everything came back normal. I ruled out it being food related because I experience the pregnant swelling no matter what foods I  eat. I also experience the swelling even drinking water. I also don't eliminate as much water considering the amount I drink throughout the day. It feels like my body is retaining everything I drink rather than eliminating it like it did before the onset of these symptoms.

It has been a mystery that many doctors I've seen over the years (medical and naturopathic) cannot find a root cause for the extreme swelling after exercise and bowel movements. Would appreciate any insight people on this forum may provide because no doctors to date have been successful in helping. Thank you.",crossfit,Swollen abdomen during and after exercise

T2B especially, I can swing my toes up and hit the bar relatively easy, but I think there is something wrong with my kip. I end up swinging too much, my coach has told me I need to work on ""snapping"" quicker into the next rep, it's like I end up resetting entirely in between each rep which takes more out of me. I don't know how to snap right back into the next rep after doing one T2B, again it's like I'm swinging too much or something. I am extremely uncoordinated lol so when I started CF I knew I'd be a disaster with any thing gymnastics related, but it still sucks knowing I have the strength to do something but there is something in my form just barely holding me back.

I'm not quite as worried about kipping pull ups right now because tbh I'd almost rather do strict anyways because I feel like that will make me stronger in the long run. Maybe if I keep improving I'd like to have kipping pull ups in my arsenal for the open or something, but it's a similar problem. It's like I stop my momentum after doing one rep.

1598694965,"Hi there! 

I'm a 39-year-old man, with a big beer belly trying out CrossFit to lose weight.

I always thought about gyms as boring places so I visited a CrossFit gym, did an experimental session, and loved it. I feel super sore but really enjoyed the experience so I'm joining.

But what should my diet be?

I know I should eat under maintenance calories, and that It is a good thing to have a high number of protein in the diet so after reading stuff around the internet ( and this varies a lot...) I came up with this:

Me: 39 years old, desk job, going to CrossFit 3 times a week, 77kg, 173cm, no muscle.

calories: 2000

protein: 160g

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on this? does this seem correct for weight loss? Do you have similar stats? if you do what do you eat during the day? do you supplement with whey protein?

I know it's a lot of questions, sorry about that..., I just wanted to do things correctly.

I’ve posted this question before but the majority of people didn’t actually read the post and just said “switch off auto pause” or “you’re accidentally hitting the two side buttons” so to make it clear, I already have auto pause turned OFF and also the setting to pause the workout when you click both side buttons turned OFF. 

When I’m training with the watch on, whether it be high intensity interval training, strength training or even outdoor run, the watch randomly pauses without reason or warning and it’s driving me insane. It also always pauses itself 11 seconds into the workout, every time. 

I’ve tried searching through Google but with no success, the only answer seems to be that the watch is loosing contact with the skin and to wear it tighter, however I’ve been experimenting with the strap tightness and it happens even when it is so tight that it begins to hurt, so I don’t believe this is the reason.

-- If you lose count of reps or sets, the lower number is it. Rather do an extra set than one too few. I also always keep a board, or an abacus, or poker chips to keep count, because I forget constantly.

-- On Olympic lifts in training, especially variations, I don't care about press out. It's harder than catching it cleanly, so why would I penalize it? Sure in a comp or in technique training, but if I'm working power if I can muscle snatch it that's good enough for me.

-- Other than stuff like EMOM or Tabata or Boxing, I always set timers for an extra :05 at the beginning for set up.

1598115460,"I would first like preface this with some background and humility. I started CrossFit in 2009 (Pre-Bok, barefoot shoes, Inov8’s and all).  At that time and years after it was either hit main site or do your local gyms workout of the day, vary rarely were people seeking out additional programming. Then in 2012 “Day in the Life of Froning” comes out on YouTube and everyone started doing “extra work”. The rise of Outlaw came and I’ll admit it, I fell hard into the loop of trying to identify being a competitive CrossFitter and doing 3-4 workouts a day. It was pretty sweet getting FREE programming that you could compare with other top athletes at the time (or just see how they crushed your dreams on the reg). Then came others like NCLab. I remember finding MisFit and looking at their week of programming and thinking “this is the hardest shit that’s out there, hands down.” It all works...kinda...until it doesn’t.  

When starting “competitive programming” as a relative novice (meaning low skill set, low oly numbers, marginal engine) this forces you to actually practice these things consistently, so of course you get better. Then confidence starts to build. Then one day after your build to a heavy snatch part A, 5x8 back squat part B, EMOM of strict handstand push ups and pull ups, you feel confident to hit the Metcon at the end of Heavy Amanda....but full snatches still aren’t your thing yet so you ugly power the OG RX weights (135/95) and do bent arm muscle ups in singles and doubles....it takes you close to 20 minutes to finish. The next day your shoulders feel like they’re falling off and your low back is so stiff getting out of bed that you look like a zombie hobbling to the bathroom. You check your Instagram feed to see what your favorite athletes are doing and you see them crushing Heavy Amanda in sub 5 minutes. The next training session you go in like a bat outta hell thinking “hwpo- I’ve got to get better” and boom, you get actually injured (torn shoulder, torn bicep, ruptured disc, torn meniscus or ACL). 

I’ve seen this time and time again and even experienced it myself (ruptured L4/L5 in 2014). 

It BLOWS my mind that there are gyms that follow CompTrain as their regular class programming. Why??? Just because they give out affiliate programming does not mean it’s right at the affiliate level. Most genpop CrossFitters just want to be strong enough to do the activities they enjoy on the weekends and look good shirtless with the added health benefits that go along with GPP functional style training. 

If you read that, and it sounds like you, please just realize just doing it to “challenge yourself” and you “love the burn” comes at a price. 

Also, if this sounds like you and you’re consistently crushing workouts, without major injury, and have qualified for Sanctionals (or fingers crossed they bring back Regionals), congrats and I’m semi jealous of your ability to stay bulletproof 💪.",crossfit,Unpopular Opinion - Competitive Programming is Overrated and Most CrossFitters Don’t Need It

1598088999,"Howdy Folks 👋

I feel like I’ve got a good base of fitness. Have been training strengths and endurance sports for a few years now. Primarily concurrently (complete human performance style). 

I’m happy to do hard run / cycle intervals, heavy lifts, long steady state runs, tempo runs etc. 

CrossFit workout though,....no bueno. 

Pretty often, with WOD’s I feel nauseous, dizzy, weak, with cold sweats and ultimately end up vomiting or coming pretty damn close and having to pause to recover before continuing on. 

I don’t think it’s nutrition timing, as I’ve played around with timing and food types. 

I thought I had a good lactic tolerance (I know it’s not lactic acid per se, but we’ll go with that for simplicity) as I seem to do fine with running / cycling. 

Is it poor lactic tolerance? Or something else. Maybe blood shunting has something to do with it?

I still think it should be about, if not anything, then at least about everything that a typical WOD programming includes. Instead it seems everyone tries to cash in with qualifiers and ""low bar"" competitions where it feels more like strongman event than actual CF.

Now I'm not saying there should be half marathon, long swim or such (in anything but maybe the Games) but reality is more like ""This is a masters competition so we won't be having any of that MU or HSW nonsense here"" or ""There will be some skills required in actual competition but the qualifier is all heavy front rack lunges and GTOH"".

I understand that any real endurance is hard to test in Open or most of the qualifiers due to required running track and/or time.

Thank you to anyone who contributes. This may be too vague/nuanced or personal for this forum, and if so, will delete with apologies. 

I began attending a kickass Crossfit box last November, around 4 times a week. Prior, I was as a total newbie to proper lifting. My attendance goal is 5 times, and I manage that now and then but average 4, sometimes it ends up at 3 if I need the recovery. I often stay an hour or 2 later to get in some extra lifting, practice or cardio. I'm 5'8, female, and small framed (age 39). I have strong goals, but wish to be realistic for my age. 

I started off extremely underweight and having to rapidly put on about 20 pounds after surgery and prolonged bedrest to be stable enough to start exercising. I was overseas at the time of my accident, and put on weight in the worst way possible. This was a couple years back, but my recovery was slow. I have since moved to America and had an extremely sedentary lifestyle before joining Crossfit. Not to diverge into the sentimental, but after my doctor essentially told me that ""I either get to gaining muscle now or give up any hope in hell of having a child and expect to suffer in ugly ways as I age), I feel Crossfit played a massive role in making my life livable. Nothing worked for me, and I was hooked, even if I cried my way through week 1 and felt like total shit in the beginning. I owe my Crossfit community more than they will ever know. Stuck with it, and happy to say I'm nearly at my first pull up :), just got my box jumps up to 30 inches from 12, and though I seldom can do a WOD at true RX, I feel awesome each time I show up.

My diet was all over the place in the beginning: I jammed myself with chicken and calories because my body cried out for it - often in extreme excess that left me feeling crappy and occasionally sick. I put on a solid, visible chunk of muscle and saw my body composition change dramatically, but felt out of control and had constant indigestion. My doctor was pleased, and declined to formally refer me to a nutritionist so that my insurance could cover it as I don't have an eating disorder and my personal funds got tight (I am looking to change doctors). 

I began using the Renaissance Periodization (RP) app on the advice of my coach about 5 months ago. This is where things got more confusing for a newbie like me who is grateful for health, but tired of feeling out of control and seeking something sustainable that leads to the goals I have, now that my health is in decent form. I was advised by the app to begin with fat loss, having over 25% body fat. My muscle percentages (using the Withings comp scale) is normal range. I feel as if I just graduated into being a ""normal but reasonably fit person"", which is no small feat considering where I started. My current goal is muscle gain, and to get the fat gain under control - though I am aware it's tough to do both. I'm now at a normal weight, fat level around 27%. My coach advised ignoring the app's advice and seeking to gain as much mass as possible ASAP - he suggested 10 pounds. The app doesn't allow to this (it maxes out at 7). I gave that a shot for a month and felt uncomfortable in my skin and unsure if what I was doing was sensible for my workout intensity. Our WODs seem to fall into ""light intensity"" category on the app, even if I throw in a little extra. I switched up to the ""maintenance"" setting on the app, and then decided to try very slow fat loss (to the degree the diet felt pretty normal). That's where I am now, and have been for the past month. 

I feel confused as I am going against the advice of my coach; not feeling like I am seeing much in terms of change, have zero context, and I fear sabotaging myself the way I did in the beginning. I noted the post regarding protein vs caloric intake for novices, and wondered if I ought to give posting a shot. I realize my situation is nuanced, but I gratefully welcome advice - on both the app and diet, and the methods suggested to me. My utmost gratitude to anyone who contributes. If this post belongs elsewhere, kindly let me know. 

Cheers.",crossfit,"Seeking a solid formula re: nutrition and work, could really use insight on RP app, diet methodology and ""novice gains"""
1598038687,"Me and my husband recently joined a local center. We’ve been wanting to get into better shape, but with covid and mask mandates it’s been difficult to get the motivation to go to the gym. We recently were told about CrossFit by one of his coworkers and she swears it’s amazing. The one she was going to was offering a free first week trial, so we kicked it on Wednesday and again this morning. Now, this past year I’ve been trying to make an effort to be more active and get my heart pumping on a daily basis, but I didn’t really have anyone to instruct me or tell me what I was doing wrong. Man, the exercise and workouts here are sooo intense and it actually pushes me to work harder than I thought I could do. The instructors are amazing, so welcoming, and the community overall is very friendly. I’ve come to like the idea of group fitness, and I enjoy that they give you the options to do other workouts if you’re not comfortable doing stuff like the lifting and heavy weights. My body is undeniably sore and I overall feel great about myself. I think both me and my husband are going to benefit long term when we return and plan with CF.

1598022809,"I am a lurker on this sub, enjoy reading the posts. 
I have been CFing for 2.5 years. I RX most movements and thrive on cardio… 

I am sharing my story to ask for input on my situation. 

Wednesday July 29th I completed the following WOD at my box. 
(CF Mayhem programming)
50 cal row
40 GHD Sit ups
30 Chest to Bar
20 burpee over dumbbell
100 ft single arm overhead lunge (50)

Prior to this workout I had been training core quire a bit and thought that I was ready for GHDs…. 
Boy was I wrong, the GHDs hit me really hard and I was only able to make it through 35 reps before moving on. (I NEVER skip reps, I  will scale before skipping reps) but I could not finish these.

The Day after this WOD I was sore but still went into the gym and worked out. Soreness was Nothing out of the ordinary. 
However, Over the next week my abs became increasingly sore, to the point that I couldn’t do ANY physical activity. 
So I  stayed out of the gym and just rested. 
12 days after the GHD WOD I was still sore and tender in the abs. 
So I went to my Doctor and he prescribed anti inflammatories…. 
They started working almost immediately and within 3 days I was feeling very good. 

Day 5 of anti inflammatories, I decided to work out at home by myself. Doctor said as soon as I was pain free for a few days it was ok to workout, just not core specific workouts. 
It was very hot outside, but still an enjoyable workout. I did 4 rounds of 
.25 mile run 
25 wall balls 
Might have used the core too much??

Later that night I started feeling terrible. Muscle aches all over my body, headaches and fatigue. 
This continued the next few days and I even had a fever off and on. Thought it might be Covid but turned out negative. 
Later on I developed a pain in my groin and went back to doctor who said I had blood in my urine and that urine was infected. 

So now, I am on day 3 of antibiotics for infection wondering what the heck is going on. Still battling groin pain/infection. 

Doctor does not believe it  could be rhabdo symptoms… and did not do blood work. They ruled out kidney stones as well. 

Doctor does not seem to think the infection is related to exercise but I can’t help but think the two things are related. 

What say you??? 

And how should I proceed with easing back into working out…. I have learned my lesson on going too hard. 
I know people will say “listen to your doctor.” And I am going to do that, but also interested in input of those who might have experienced something similar.",crossfit,Help getting back to working out

First time poster, longtime lurker. 

Have been slowly adding some weights to my garage gym and have the opportunity to buy 50lbs steel hex dumbbells at a reasonable price with free shipping. My question is what are people's experiences with steel dumbbells for CrossFit style workouts (thrusters, front squats, snatches, cleans, etc.) as opposed to the more common rubber counterpart.

I don't plan on exactly throwing the weights around and damaging them/the floor, but are there other drawbacks to the steel as opposed to rubber ones? E.g. would they be less comfortable doing thrusters / front squats.

1598000730,"Hi Guys,

I'm thinking of starting Crossfit (again) because I'm quitting Muay Thai because of the damage it does to your brain and I can't afford that as an 23yo male pursuing a Master's in Supply Chain Management and with my whole career in front of me.

I did Crossfit a couple of years ago and at the time I combined it with Muay Thai (2 WODs a week and 3 times Muay Thai a week). But now that I'm quitting Muay Thai I'm looking for another type of training to combine the WODs with. I'm thinking of doing 2-3 WODs a week.

I'm insterested in bodyweight training, Calisthenics, running and yoga. But I'm not sure if doing a WOD on Monday, bodyweight routine on Tuesday, WOD on Wednesday, bodyweight routine on Thursday, yoga on Friday and a WOD on Saturday might be too much for my body to handle. I combined bodyweight training with my Muay Thai training sessions but I found that those training sessions have a different kind of impact on your body then an WOD does. 

The main reason that I want to do something besides the WOD is because I want to get more muscular and I think that doing Crossfit isn't going to get me more muscular, it gets me more lean.

FYI: I'm 23yo male 75kg (165 pounds) 183cm (72 inch).

You guys got any thoughts on what type of training to combine with the WODs?",crossfit,Thinking of starting Crossfit but don't know which type of training to combine with the WODs

I tried some light shoulder mobility exercise but it's quite painful. Pvc pass throughs are pretty much impossible.

1. Focus on **building value** for affiliates.  Apps, education, resources; streamlining of things that can help with branding.  i.e.: What if CFHQ offered a way for affiliates to get t-shirts (*custom?*) at a much lower price than individually sourcing per gym?  *CF is pricey and doesn't have a whole lot to offer for a costly affiliation; they recognized this and are adding value.  Serious emphasis on adding value.*
2. Focus on DEI.  Lots of focuses, including underserved communities, getting more diversity into spotlights/role models, and enabling boxes in less optimal regions to bring clients in without an enormous burden.
3. International focus.  ""Currently it seems like it's America vs. everybody else"" and that's not a good thing for an international community.  New international affairs exec.  Lots of stuff from the previous point ties into this.  Things like affiliation cost in less privileged areas, are under serious consideration.
4. Open is aimed at February/March, Games ""later"" than previous.  Goal of 500k participants in the Open.
5. Find ways for athletes to make a living off of Crossfit, like many other sports.  Part of this is growing viewership; goal of 1B international viewers of events, within 10 years.

I signed up to take my level one back in March. Due to covid, it got pushed to April, that one was canceled, so it got pushed to May. That one was cancelled, and finally, it landed in June, in Kansas City, MO. 

Crossfit Northland in KCMO was awesome. The biggest issue for me was Covid did not allow the use of fans..in the midwest..in the middle of June...that was touuuggghhhh... I digress, the staff was awesome and the facility was clean. 

I've always been a bigger guy. At one point in my life, I was 390 lbs. My buddy got me into Crossfit, and over the next 1.5 years I dropped over 120 lbs.  I walked into the gym feeling, well, scared and self conscious because I am a bigger guy (definitely stronger than most people I  workout with, but my cardio/body type is not what you would look for in a fitness coach). Everyone was so nice. I really didn't feel like anyone looked at me and went ""Seriously?""  That was pretty dope.  Also, in the midst of the Glassman issue. 

Day one was a lot of information to take in. We went over 5 of the 9 foundational movements. The lectures were good, and in depth, It's important if you have any type of ADHD or vision problems that you sit right in front. They cover things fairly quickly, and take good notes! We did a workout that was tough, and people finished between 2:30 and 11:00 minutes. (I was right around the 6:30 mark, yay me). We ended the day on a lecture. 

Day two was more of the same, going over the rest of the movements, finished up with the GHD (take good notes on this) and then it was time for the celebration. They handed me Form D. The questions felt like they were designed to trip you up a little bit. I took about 45 minutes, felt the least amount confident and turned it in. 

Result: Fail. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was the first test I have ever failed in my life. I felt terrible. There were a lot of people counting on me to pass this, so we could get a 6:30 class at my gym, I failed them. I told myself I would not give up and go back at it. For the next 30 days, I studied the pathways, the movements, rhabdo, the zone diet, the definitions of Crossfit.  I typed out all of my notes from the class, and studied them intensely. I did the Crossfit flashcards on quizlet, and go ready for my test on August 9th. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got there about an hour early, had one specific question which was answered, and then test time. They handed out the tests, we went through the filling out of basic information and...17 minutes. It took me 17 minutes to finish the test. I felt so good, I knew I passed. I was comfortable with most of my answers. I was answering the questions before I finished reading them. I got my results on Friday, it was a pass!  

I'm ready to start helping people achieve their goals. Half of my family has had the fat surgery. My entire family at one point has been morbidly obese. I'm breaking that cycle. I'm hoping I can give life to people who feel they can't. I'm also ready to help people get strong, get fit, and feel better about themselves. Being a data analyst, who works behind a desk, and has been almost at the 400 lb mark with an A1c of 12.9, I feel I can relate and motivate anyone within that realm to do better and better themselves, having been there myself.

Anywho, last night I got an email from my gym. It was saying there was someone who was COVID positive in a class as late as yesterday (the day they sent the email!!). They said anyone who has been in class should be tested ASAP, and they'll be shutting down the gym for a week to prevent spread.


Wow did I make the right choice. They don't ever enforce masks, no one ever wore masks, and one of the coaches put a really dumb take on his Instagram about COVID19. It was just waiting to happen.

However yesterday I met a new friend. 

I noticed someone who was 5'3 but yet lifting very heavy weights and smashing pure cardio. I've always been sceptical to CrossFit due to the stereotypes and the somewhat alienated world it belongs in. Yet I asked what they was doing and to my surprise, I was offered to be shown and taught how to do some dynamic lifts properly. 

Ill be honest, giving my physical statutory i was confident I would be able to smash it. Yet when someone literally half my size is lifting the weights the as me and more, I knew I entered a whole new ball game. 

So my curiosity got the better than me and I asked if i could train with them. At this point I was roughly taught what a WOD was and I set about it.

Never in my life have I felt such a full body work out and cardio experience. I was fucked to say the least. From the end of that work out I knew what I had been doing was not best suited to me.

I've learnt that this is what is best for me and I've never been so motivated to learn!

I’ve been doing CF for a couple of years and last year I moved to the other side of the country to live with my boyfriend. I joined his CF box and things went.. well. I train on a regular basis (4 times a week) and I noticed I am getting to the point of no improvement. I like my coaches on a personal level, but to be honest.. they are not professional coaches. They are not open to any tips/advice or feedback. People that tried to change their way of coaching eventually moved to another box. Right now I feel like I am stuck. Whenever I ask something I either get ignored or the headcoach scoffs at me. It makes me feel very uncomfortable. I am a kind of insecure if it comes to technique and need a lot of help. Instead of helping me out my headcoach said ‘oh so this is how y’all do it in *my previous box’.

I've been researching for the last 2 weeks and have found several examples of MetCons and tabatas, and lots of mention of adding them to a training session, but no good explanation of how to structure them.

What I mean is: Would it be better to pair a metcon with a similar lift, for additional volume, or with something else to fill it out?  Does it even matter?  For example, I'm looking at Diane: 21-15-9 of 225lb DL and Handstand Push-ups.  Would it be more beneficial to do these on a heavy Deadlift session, or something else like squat/press?

Also, would additional cardio (i.e. morning runs/rucks) hinder my ability to perform these sessions later (lunch break)?

After some layoff from Crossfit due to Lockdown I started training again around 4 weeks ago. I have transitioned to the Rx weights for most workouts but am struggling with recovery. Although I can manage the weight I don't necessarily finish in time. My coach understands this and I usually work through my WODs even after the class has reached the time cap.

I am 31 years old, male, and have been training all my life. There are many Rx movements (specifically gymnastics) that I still can't do but for now I am focussing on increasing strength and moving Rx weights.

How does one deal with recovery? If I do scaled I can train 5/6 times a week. With Rx, I've had a few workouts where I had to skip a day afterwards because I just felt way too broken down. I've increased my calories and need to improve my sleep routine, too. But in general I feel like I can manage 4 days of training without dying.

Both tracks Will have 3-4 Weekly sessions ranging from under 10 minutes to 50-60 minutes for The longest ones. 

The programmes Will be available in The TrueCoach app and you Will get a try at The Beta version of The programme. 
It Will launch on monday august 24th. 

All you need to do to sign up, is post a comment, send me a message with name, age, gender and e-mail and I’ll get you started. If you already have another coach programming for you in TrueCoach, you’ll need to use a different e-mail.

While my gym was shut down, I started exercising in front of my house, which lead to a few neighbors becoming curious and asking to join me. I told them I wasn't a coach or a trainer, but they were welcome to be in the same place doing the same thing as me. I gave them general pointers on form based on my gym experience, but that was it.

When the gym opened back up, I went back bit they still wanted to work out and asked if I could continue to provide them advice and workouts. I really enjoyed our workouts and the atmosphere (has me thinking about coaching), so I said sure. Now, I am basically giving them dumbbell and bodyweight programming three times a week, and being present and giving them for advice.

So my question is am I opening myself up to a law suite if one of them drops a dumbbell on their foot? They don't pay me, they use their own equipment, it is not done on my property, and they know that I do not have any certifications beyond personal experience.

1597203144,"tldr; I am about to finish year one of /u/gainslab Year of the Engine. Recorded all workouts and [visualised the data here](https://df.id.au/yoe-year1/). May be useful if you are curious about effort and time is involved. Includes my 10:00 time trial results on the bike.

&amp;#x200B;

[Year of the Engine](https://www.thegainslab.com/engine) is a capacity program by Matt Wiebke, known on /r/crossfit as /u/gainslab. There are semi-regular questions posted here regarding content and duration of the program. This post is to show the data that I collected over the last (almost) 12 months, including one set of results, to try and help answer some these questions.

Please note this is not a subjective review of the program, just presentation of data.

**Visualisations**

* [https://df.id.au/yoe-year1/](https://df.id.au/yoe-year1/)
* Works on desktop Safari or Chrome. Works on mobile but hard to see detail.

**Subject**

* Male, late 40's, average exerciser, desk-based worker, non-athlete. Focusing on health.
* CrossFit since 2012 (garage for a couple of years, then affiliate for a few years, now back in the garage).

**Program**

* Broken up into monthly chunks, each containing 4 weeks. 5 workouts per week.
* Workouts vary between intervals, endurance (""steady state""), polarisation, FLUX and time trials. [More about that here](https://www.thegainslab.com/engine).
* Athlete may use rower, SkiErg, Assault bike / Echo bike / AirDyne, running. Athlete may chop and choose between apparatus per-workout.
* Workouts may move around in the week as athlete chooses, but not cross over weeks.

**Method**

* Started the program September 2019.
* Consistently five workouts per 7-day week, excepting times of illness, injury, travel, family needs.
* I used the Concept2 rower for intervals, AirDyne for longer efforts, SkiErg every now-and-again.
* I moved sessions around, trying to do longer sessions at end of the week to fit in with life.

**Data**

* Rower and SkiErg results recorded using ErgData.
* AirDyne results recorded post-workout.
* Both sets of data collated into a single file [available here](https://df.id.au/yoe-year1/js/data.js).

**Interpretation**

* The graphs show how much time and distance were covered per workout, per week and per phase of the program.
* The apparatus shown were based on my choice, as provided by the program.
* The position of different workout types in the week were my choice, as provided by the program.
* Workout specific detail has been removed; work periods, rest intervals and intensity levels have either been aggregated or left out. If you want more information on the program get in touch with /u/gainslab.

**A preview of results**

* The final graph is my results for six 10:00 AirDyne time trials over the course of the program.

**Final word**

I hope this data gives some idea of how much time is involved in the program, and the final graph shows that I did get gains in the 10:00 TT. Happy to answer any questions on the data. For program specific stuff, contact /u/gainslab. I will be following up with a review of year one in a few weeks.",crossfit,Year of the Engine: data from a (almost) complete year on the program

1597095904,"Hello, crossfitters! I've (30 F) recently moved and joined a new gym. This particular gym was recommended by a friend, and between my drop-in class and my friend's description, it sounded like the right box for me (I like a no nonsense atmosphere, so that I'm motivated to do better). There are a few other gyms close-by, but the next best one seems like a very friendly, encouraging environment where most members are working moms and dads, and they're welcome to bring their little ones. I specifically avoided this gym since I'm not a parent, and I don't want kids around distracting me while I'm trying to exercise and hear the coach. Fast forward to my second week there; every single class had a minimum of two children (ten year old age range) attending class. The kids were, ofcourse, doing a different workout, and most of them were very new to any sort of exercise and therefore needed a lot of special attention and modifying. On top of that, (obviously) children tend to forget about social distancing and not touching their faces, so there is that aspect as well.

Now, I've been crossfitting for about a year and a half, but I am currently working through an injury. So I would not say that I'm expecting a TONNE of special attention, but I'd like the coach to pass by once in a while and give me a form check, or have an extra three minutes at the start of class to help me decide which moves to focus on and scale. Also, I don't want to be a huge a-hole, but kids aren't really my thing. I don't HATE them but I'm not enjoying working out in a class full of them. 

Any recommendations on how to handle this? I've been considering simply trying to go to the later classes in the evening and see if there are any children then (though I prefer morning or early afternoon workouts), and if I still have no luck, I'll start thinking about finding a new gym. Do you think it's worth talking to the owner? I am brand new there, and I don't want anyone thinking that I'm some sort of child-hating jerk! 

Any advice would be appreciated, even if it's ""stop being a whiner and be happy that the next generation is trying to get out there and kill it"".

PCr is then replenished by oxidative (mostly) and glycolytic energy production.  It **does not organically produce ATP**, so it is not an energy system.  

When the demand for ATP exceeds the supply, PCr goes down.  It has absolutely nothing to do with ""the first 7 seconds"" or anything like that; this decrease in PCr will occurs at any time in the workout when ATP demand exceeds supply.   PCr never runs out because it is re-synthesized by the other energy systems, mostly oxidative.  

Capacity is determined by the *interaction* of the oxidative and glycolytic systems, and it's not the duration of the task(s) that determines how it works.  The two energy systems (yep, I said it!)  work independently but do interact.

So in February 2016 I went to my primary care doctor because my anxiety and depression was bad.  2015 was a horrible year for me.  I found out my weight was a little above 300lbs.  Being told that flipped a switch for me and starting on that day in February i started walking/jogging/running six nights a week 6-8 miles a night until i started getting plantar fasciitis in September 2016.  At this point i was down to 260.  I couldn’t run like I had been for the previous 6+ months so i joined planet fitness.  I found i had to join trainer based classes or i just didn’t have the motivation or any results.

From September 2016 - June 2016 I lost another 20 pounds but it was so slow and unmotivating I joined a CrossFit gym.  From June 2017 through April 2018 I got down to 200 but then had to stop because of my chronic migraines (I have up to 24 a month).  My gall bladder crapped out on me from the huge weigh loss of 300lbs to 200lbs in a year in a half apparently.  I joined CrossFit back up after clearance and when i rejoined I was weighing 185lbs.  

Fast forward to today.  The whole time I have been eating healthy and watching my portions.  After OCR ended my weight went from 185 to 195.  I wasn’t happy with this and set up with a trainer who started helping me with everything until covid hit.  

I’m now at 215 pounds and my depression and anxiety is horrible.  I do workout 5-6 days a week which consists of the CrossFit gym.  Since March my steps have gone from 15,000 to 3,000-4,000 so this past week I have purposefully returned to at least going on a five mile walk at night.

I’m still watching my nutrition and portions.  My sleep has been crap though and I am simply not losing the weight.  I’ve tried changing my mental focus from weight loss to muscle gain but I’ve seen my strength decreasing over the past year and I just don’t understand why.  I’m going to the doctor today just to establish with a new doctor since I lost my last one of 20 years.  I’ll request a full panel blood draw to be done .

I've been attending CrossFit classes 3 times per week on average, since June 28 of this year. I really enjoy the overall structure of it. 

I am looking leaner and dropping sole unnecessary and unhealthy weight. I like seeing that. 

So, I try to attend CrossFit 3 times per week. I also try to do a 5km run 3 days per week.

I want to lose fat and build muscle. I want to be in overall great shape. I want to be able to run, walk, lift, and participate in what fun life has to offer. I also want to look good physically. 

My big picture goal is to be in the best shape of my life by the time I'm 50. That's somewhat vague, and I'll work on the particulars of that goal.

I don't want manboobs anymore. Lol
I want a nice chest, and a nice muscular shape in general. Not bulked you like a rigid brick, but flexible and lean and overall healthy.

So, what should I be doing when not at CrossFit and when not running 5km?
And any help making my goals more measurable and specific are welcome too.

Male, 5'10 214 lbs in case you're wondering. 

Thanks everyone! Excited to read your replies.

1596918097,"Okay since we're asking opinions here... I'm wondering what to do in this situation. A few months ago a new coach came in. My box is owned by two people and there are 5-6 coaches. One guy is new to coaching in general (was previously a personal trainer. He's not CF certified, my box disaffiliated). I come to the 5:30AM class regularly. At my box, the coaches play their own playlists which play throughout the entire box, not just the class.

This guy plays that EMO SCREAMO music. It's AWFUL. Not only just bad music, but not really exercise music and really really not what I want to hear at 5:30AM for an hour. He also doesn't turn it down when he's giving instructions or demonstrating the move. So he's talking and no one can hear him above the screaming. It has gotten to the point where when I go to schedule my class (we have to book online now) and I see he's the coach there, I will either skip or go to the PM class. And that really sucks because I love AM classes.

1596905645,"I just finished my first week of CrossFit. I did 4 WOD's and I have a couple of questions.

Obviously my wods were heavily scaled. I used half or the RX weight for most of the wods to focus on form and to get me through the wod. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Skills and strength**

Before most wods we had a short session (10-15min) that was focused on skill or strength. 

How do you get stronger and better at movements with such limited time allocated to skill learning and strength? The wod itself seemed like a (very hard) conditioning work out and definitely not a time to work on skill and strength. Or am I missing something?

There is a weekly Olly class which I'm planning on attending soon. I'm assuming that once I get a grasp of the basic mechanics of the olympic movements I'll be able to also work on my strength during these classes.

But what about all the other movements? How do you go from ring rows to pull ups to muscle ups with that little time to practice them. To people work on them outside of class? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Scaling**

This leads me to my next question which is about scaling. I understand how to scale weight but what about bodyweight exercises? We had a wod the other day which had 9 chest to bars for 6 rounds in it.

I can do 10 strict pull up (chin above bar) but I can't do 54 of them. Neither do I know how to do the kipping variant. So do I start with strict pull ups and when I fail switch to ring rows for the remainder of reps. Do I use a band thick enough to get me through the wod?

I know I'm just starting out so I think as time goes I'll be better at estimating how to scale properly and still getting through the wod.

&amp;#x200B;

**Focus during WODs**

My last question is about the mental part I guess. While doing the wod I was pushing hard and it was very hard for me to stay focused. It's like I'm in full fight or flight mode just steaming ahead and suddenly the wod is over. And I'm kinda left with a what just happened feeling.

Being in this state makes it really hard to focus on my form and pacing. Is this something that will get better with time? Does this mean I'm pushing too hard?",crossfit,Beginner questions

Is it alright to practice the kipping pullup every day?

&amp;#x200B;

New to the sub hoping I can get some feedback. I've been working out in my garage through Covid-19 mostly doing meathead routines (No disrespect) but with the fitness evaluation for firefighting coming up I wanted to get into more functional fitness rather than bodybuilding. So to summit Mt. Whatsyourpoint, I was wondering how people structure their routines. I don't have a particular goal in terms of weightlifting 1RM but do want to get better over time. The overall WOD is what I'm referring to. Is there a method to choosing what WOD to do that day or is it random (i.e Random WOD Generator)?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

How do you choose what your WOD is every day?

The coaches were pretty good about providing cleaning supplies to clean the equipment and marking out separate squares for each member to workout in. Seems they were being pretty good

1596606821,"TLDR: My main goal is to look like the men in the photos I attached, and I started out skinny-fat and have made some progress since but plateaued. Should I change nothing, add progressive overload lifting after CrossFit classes, or replace the prescribed daily workouts with my own programming?

Hi, I'm a 22-year-old, 5'9 male who weighs 170 lb. I'm currently 21-22% body fat. I get 9-11 hours of sleep per night, often very late (e.g. 5 a.m. - 3 p.m.) but also pretty random. My BMR was professionally measured at 1,947 calories, so my TDEE is probably around 2,500 calories. I do CrossFit an hour a day, 5 days a week.

I did a lot of research and made myself a meal plan. I'll be attempting body recomposition (simultaneously building muscle and burning fat) by eating my maintenance-level 2,500 calories, but if that doesn't work, I'll ramp up to 3,000 calories for a lean bulk to put on the 7 lb. of muscle I lost during quarantine, then gradually cut down to 2,200 or so calories to get to 10% body fat. I'll be eating 200g protein, 55g fat, and 300g carbs, or if I end up lean bulking, then 200g protein, 67g fat, and 400g carbs.

Not to be overlooked, I have a cheat day once a week on average. On those days I'll pig out with my buddies and eat 4,566 calories, 159g protein, 140g fat, and 417g carbs worth of hibachi, Buffalo Wild Wings, and alcohol (1 25 oz. Smirnoff Ice Smash, 6 8 oz. Straw-Ber-Ritas - 9 drinks worth total, all 16 proof). These are the only days I can let loose and have fun, so I'd much rather work around this than remove/reduce it, but if I absolutely must, I will.

I used to be skinny-fat until I started doing CrossFit. That is, I looked somewhat scrawny (not quite like a twig) with a shirt on, but somewhat chubby with my shirt off. My lift numbers were downright embarrassing, and my metcon times were abysmal. Now, I could still probably be put in the skinny-fat category, but at least now I'm a tiny bit muscular and slightly toned. My lift numbers are on the advanced end of intermediate, and my metcon times are respectable, but these have both plateaued.

My main goal is to look muscular and lean like the men in the photos I attached to this post. My secondary goal is to be as fit/athletic as possible - that includes raw strength, speed, endurance, explosiveness, mobility, technique, etc.

At my local box, the daily routine is usually 15-20 minutes of heavy lifting followed by the metcon for 12-30 minutes. On any given day, the heavy lifting portion is about 50% likely to show up on the whiteboard, and the metcon time lengths vary a ton. Ever since the box reopened, we haven't been able to do barbell bench presses, back squats, or 1RM front squats, nor have we been doing any progressive overload programs like we used to (e.g. 8-5-3-2-1 squats on Mondays, bench presses on Tuesdays, deadlifts on Wednesdays). At my local box, we are allowed to stay after class and use any of the equipment.

My question is this: is my current CrossFit regimen completely compatible with my goals, or do I need to make changes? More specifically, should I: change nothing at all, add progressive overload lifting after class, or write my own programming instead of the prescribed workouts? I've scoured the internet, probably 20+ hours, searching for answers, but every single bit of information I've found leaves some ambiguity that may or may not invalidate it, given my precise background.

So my fiancé and I decided to join a cf gym in our hometown together.  We decided it would be a great way to challenge each other.  She has also reached an issue with staying motivated and asked if I would start going with her.  I’ve been to a few WODS, and I’m still learning the lifts and correct form, I know that will come with more experience.  
She has been in the sport for maybe 8 years, and has had a mixed results, mostly due to her crazy work schedule, it’s been really hard for her to buckle down and hit the gym as much as she needs too. 
Recently she has been More into Olympic lifting and goes two a lifting coach x2 a week, she also work 3rd shift 12 hours.  So it’s difficult for her to handle everything.  I on the other hand work less hours, my commute is shorter, and I have a lot more free time on my hands.

1596570115,"I’ve been on and off CrossFit for the last 5 years, but recently-ish found a box where I just absolutely love the programming and the people. Late July 2019 I dislocated my left shoulder while hiking. Took 12 weeks of physical therapy and a month after I went back to the gym on November 2019. I worked really hard to build shoulder strength gradually. Was always aware of my bad shoulder. Always reminded my coaches and scaled down the weight on Turkish getups and anything that demanded single arm overhead with weight.

We get back to the now and I’ve had zero problems - minus the fact that I’m 5 months pregnant - but still modifying like a boss and feeling great. We do kettlebell windmills and I severely scale down because although my arm is locked out there’s a bit movement there - so I substitute a dumbbell instead of a kettlebell just so it feels more balanced and only use 20 lbs. I’m a tiny girl so even at 5 months pregnant I’m only 114 lbs, so it wasn’t a ton of resistance when put in perspective. 

On the 3rd set, I feel a small pop in my shoulder and I knew I was done. Not really any pain - not really much trauma - I just take my dumbbell down with my good arm though I absolutely knew that my shoulder was fucked again. After setting it back in place and talking to a sports doctor, he didn’t think I was doing anything too terribly wrong - he said it was probably more due to a) previous dislocation b) joints loosening much more than normal while pregnant due to extra relaxin.

I guess I’m just looking for advice? I’ve heard all the horror stories of how it just gets worse with every dislocation and I’m just getting demoralized and honestly getting fearful that I’ll never be able to workout without fear that I’ll dislocate again and increase my chances even more for the next one. It sucks to literally have to do this tango of taking several months off again for PT, and then back to square 1 on all my lifts because oh y’know you need to be even on both shoulders to start going for 1 rep maxes.

I'm an app developer, so naturally I decided to build [an app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/burpee-hero/id1509074551) to track all this and gamify it a bit. I've logged 2958 burpees, 3212 squats, 1793 sit-ups, and 2229 push-ups since I started working on the app back in March.

Wondering what people's thoughts are on the change of membership enforced on all members of my gym post covid and see if anyone else's gyms have had to change. 

I used to pay £73 a month for unlimited access. Classes included Crossfit, S&amp;C, intervals, endurance and Strongman. It was epic, I loved it. 

We received an email a few weeks ago telling us that the membership had changed. Everyone would be put on a membership for £46 a month and that would give access to 2 interval/hiit type workouts a week and 3 open gym slots. If you want, you can 'add on' one 'focus' clsss a week for an extra £30 a month or 2 for £55. These would be small classes of no more than 5 people. If you want access to any programming such as 'Strength' or 'Performance' it costs an extra £5 per programme, however, this would be included if you choose an 'add on'. 

My new cost would be £101 a month for 5 classes a week. I'm quite annoyed by this as it also appears we're not even affiliated anymore. So no Crossfit.

1596465359,"Hello all !

A few months ago, while in the prime of quarantine, I made a post asking what was everyone's favorite CrossFit documentary! Had some really cool answers, and some even brought about other videos I had never seen

I understand that much has changed within CrossFit, the Games and the community since then, so I hope not to make anyone upset with this. I also understand from what I've seen lately on this sub, is that people have been posting about their home gyms they created, so I hope to not make this post to take away from that...

Currently I am getting back into fitness for an 8-week transformation contest, and just for myself beyond that in general... Spent the last few years partying and eating WAY too many donuts... Whoops!

Anyways, as we've reached mid-Summer, I sit here thinking about ordering up some more FitAid drinks, making a bomb ass healthy meal, and watching a good ole CrossFit Docu for extra motivation before crushing some workouts....

*MY IDEA: maybe every Monday (or even twice a week) I will watch and post a review on something CrossFit video related. Docu's, Road to the Games, A day in the Life (of random Crossfitter). I would like to speak on maybe what I enjoyed about the video, what pumped me up or motivated me to get going, or just talk in general and see how everyone is doing!

 I'm hoping that this encourages you all to watch it as well, and y'all can give your input in that daily posts comments? I enjoy talking to yall sometimes and seeing everyone succeed.

Kinda thinking this can bring the community together even further, and push each other... would anyone be interested in this??? (Sorry if you don't enjoy watching any of this stuff too)",crossfit,Would you be willing to watch and review Documentaries and YouTube videos?

I am constantly in a battle of contrasts, especially myself because I have a history when it comes to fitness and all the things that are associated with it.

I was overweight when I was young, got bullied and rejected for it. It happened a long, long time ago and I have delved with a lot of therapy and self-help to get over those dark times but even though I have managed to find a way to be above these troubles, those demons linger in the back of my mind.

I still suffer from self-doubt, being self-conscious about my weight, my looks, my diets and everything.

Sometimes I am not sure if I am being disciplined and dedicated, or whether I am being obsessed and unhealthy because unfortunately, I went through an eating disorder at a very young age and even those demons still linger every now and then.

Sometimes I feel like that I need to eat a lot to maintain my size and to gain muscle. Plus, being a foodie, I find this a plus.

Sometimes I feel the need to make sure that I am keeping myself in check and constantly doubting my habits because I am not sure if I am doing things right or I am being obsessed or making myself unhealthy or following a fitness fad

Sometimes I want to be sure that I am doing things right because I know how the fitness industry tries to profit from all the insecurities and misconceptions about fitness, or mainstream thought continue to push inaccurate or misinformed beliefs about fitness.

Sometimes I feel like I am in a battle between wanting to accept myself as I am because I am aware that people have their own body types and ways of living, while also finding out if I should better myself even though I know that the so-called “ideal body type” changes from time to time and shifts and changes depending on the trends or whatever Hollywood body is the most famous.

Sometimes I want to stick to my diet and exercise routine to be consistent, disciplined and mature about my goals and desires. Sometimes I feel that I should be flexible and not as strict and expose myself to other ideas and even other foods and ways of living because life is too short to live in one way and I wish to experience it like an adventure worth living.

Because of quarantine, the only gym open in my area was a Krav Maga/crossfit box w/ outdoor classes. Best decision of my life joining despite it being pricier than a traditional gym.

With that being said, I banged up my shoulder playing hockey September 2019 but I had to play through this past season as it was my senior year.

But this past week, I decided to stay after for a krav maga class and I guess the violent swings re-aggrevated my right shoulder.

1596302809,"   I'm immunocompromised. So Im feeling pretty angry about all this.

 Since our gym re-opened the only thing they have done is purchase mops, some hand-sanitizer and fabuloso in spray bottles.  The idea is that members wipe down equipment and 'mop' the floor (its basically dry mopping with a sponge).   

  Hardly anyone does this and Im fairly certain regular fabuloso isnt a disinfectant.   No one wears masks. Ever.  Even My partner only wore one when  I was there and Id force him because its "" too difficult"" . I basically had to threaten him and this is after Ive already had a week-long stint in the hospital earlier this year.     I have even taken to bringing my own disinfectant and wipes and working by myself in a corner  .

So about a month ago our gym had a smaller competition (still around 60 ppl).  Again no one wore masks.  A friend of mine went with cold symptoms. The next day tested negative. Two days later tested positive. 

The gym owner did not announce the possible exposure. During this  I really felt like I couldnt speak  to the gym owner, especially when I was pressured by friends and family not to "" start anything"" and I barely speak to her on a regular basis since I hardly ever take her classes and no one really chats at the 5 a.m class.  I also want let you know my partner and I get a discount on our membership that makes me feel like I *cant* say anything. 

Then two weeks ago my regular coach is diagnosed. Hes out. Still no announcement, just a subbed in coach.

Then last week, huge competition, I find out that an attendee that I know, knew he was covid pos and went,then he took his mask off because he ""felt silly"".  All pictures show zero social distancing at the event, masks on ears, competitors with no masks at all hugging.

This week the sub coach laughs about how she is sick, can barely breathe and doesnt feel well after attending competition. She's a teacher. She isnt a mask wearer. She doesnt want to get tested.  

  I went on instagram and todays our gyms community (free class) day. No one masked. Group photo of 30.    So I look on social media some more and no gyms in our area have masks and so many group photos.   

   How do I talk to the gym and community about this?  What is with FLorida?! What would you do? How does your box handle it? How do I bring up this conversation ( I am a huge introvert if you couldnt tell by my posting this on reddit first )? 

I know a safer environment is possible! I go to a climbing gym and they do things like take your temp at the door , sanitizing stations every couple of feet, fewer people allowed in, UV light filtration in the a.c.! When they got a covid exposure there, they announced it immediately, called all people who were there at the time, shut the gym down for 48 hours while they cleaned and then had UV lights spotlighted everywhere during. They pulled down every single hold then sanitized and power-washed them.",crossfit,Covid Rant. Be Warned! Im extremely frustrated!

1596291693,"Hi everyone,

Recently I joined a crossfit box. My main motive was because they have a very good olympic weightlifting department and offer a lot of classes. In the process I realised my conditioning was not on par so instead of doing olympic weightlifting only, I decided to also do some crossfit classes. I really like that there is a lot of variety in the exercise we do and the many many ways in which the HIIT is incorporated in the wods. Lately I've been having trouble finding motivation to push myself throughout the wods, and it almost feels like an obstacle to go to the box and do the wod(also after the wod I am just absolutely drained).

Since I prefer Olympic weightlifting over crossfit, fail to understand other peoples reasons for crossfit. A lot of people at the box seem to favour crossfit over weightlifting (for me it's the other way around). So I was wondering, why do you guys love crossfit (and/or dislike olympic weightlifting)?",crossfit,Crossfit and olympic weightlifting
1596291073,"Ladies and Gentleman, some time ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/gys9nf/had_my_first_class_yesterday/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about my first CF-Class. Now, around 1 Month later, I'll give a small update on me, my CF-experience and about the best thing in Crossfit (in my opinion).

So, in this one Month I did my classes, mostly 4 a week, (with always getting sure to get my rest of course) and I achieved some pretty good progress. Achieved many PRs, got to know the Crossfit World and my fellow Crossfitters. I've failed many WODs, because I went too hard in the last round, I finished many way too fast because I did it with not enough weight, and in some, I did it all just right. Like I could finish just in time, but faster just wasn't an option. One time, I was standing there, Round 5 out if 6 in an EMOM, and even with the last two round being hard as f***,  I suddenly hit some deep power inside. The world and all was clear, and the next Squat Clean went up like it was nothing. 
That (and the almost throwing up afterwards) where feelings I'll always try to feel again. It was like some kind of drug.  

But what I really, really love about Crossfit, is that feeling of being part of something. Today we had a 1.August (the Swiss Nationalday) WOD in a box nearby. I'm not 18 yet, so I needed to go by train. Well, I had to, if not a fellow crossfitter would have given me a lift. I didn't ask for it, She kinda just came and insisted. There the same, I knew now one, but everyone was super friendly. Gave tipps, pushed me, and accepted my tipps or thoughts. Then we all grilled together afterwards, and again, everyone being cool with everyone, talking about everything and really being interested in what I said. And when everything was over, I needed to go to some place, and around 4-5 persons, I knew only two of them, offered me to give me a lift. 

And this is what I love the most about Crossfit. The group aspect. Something you kinda can't put into words, you just have to experience it. 

And hell am I thankfully for that experience.",crossfit,What I really love about Crossfit

I started CrossFit last year at 300lbs. Never did any sort of exercise before this. Overweight, unhealthy, unhappy, and terrified! I hated physical activity, I grew up with parents that worked then came home and did nothing. I never knew physical activity was something to do everyday just for fun. My favorite pastime was eating large amounts of crap and not doing anything all day. 

I had a friend who started CrossFit and loved it, she would rave about the box she went to, how great she felt, how amazing the programming was so I signed up to talk to a coach. I went there not prepared to change my life at all, just wanted to hangout with my friend more and as I spoke to the owner I just realized how much better life could be. I signed up for foundations that day, finished in a week and did my first wod. I thought I was going to die but in a good way. I had never felt so powerful and strong I wanted to do it again and again and get stronger and do more! So that’s what I’ve been doing. I’ve missed maybe a handful of classes, I go 6x a week, I’ve made so many new friends who love to go out and do things instead of go out to eat and do nothing. It is truly my favorite time of the day now. My life has been 100% changed for the better! 

I’m currently down 84 pounds, still have a lot to go but I’m just eating right and maki sure to move everyday. I’m so much more confident and comfortable in my own body now. I feel like the me I should have been for my whole life. I don’t know if that makes sense.

  That said, all of these guys and girls that are in crossfit games are absolute beasts ..they are all very muscular, very lean and they are operating at extremely high output. This is what makes me go hmmmm .. I know what it's like to get much leaner while trying to keep muscle mass. It's difficult but very doable if you are dedicated but I also know how my performance suffers the leaner I get. I'm not even that close to being as shredded as these crossfit games competitors though. I have been around gyms for long enough to know what people can achieve naturally and what they cannot

  Are all of these crossfit games athletes just complete genetic freaks? Or Are they genetic freaks that also  take steroids and other performance enhancers? Obviously they are super dedicated to their craft but there's something ekse going on there

  The women's physiques in a 5 year span have changed dramatically. They went from looking like fitness model types to NFL running backs lol.. Again, these women are not only very muscular but shredded and I know how difficult this is to accomplish when your estrogen is high and testosterone isn't. 

  I know crossfit dies test it's athletes but don't have to release the results to anyone.. Seems occasionally a crossfit athlete tests positive but it's not like 90% of athletes are failing drug tests. I'd love to know if they are drug tested AT the Crossfit games?

But in the two months that I’ve been doing CrossFit, I have lost 10 pounds. A lot of which is muscle. I’ve hired a nutrition coach to get my diet right. My goal is to gain muscle mass.  He’s saying that perhaps because of my body type and my goal, CrossFit is too high intensity. That perhaps I should go with strictly lifting heavy, low reps with a bit of steady state cardio in the mix along with a high protein, high calorie diet. I’m gonna stick with CrossFit for now because I’m just beginning his diet. He says that if I consume enough calories and protein that I could still gain muscle mass even though I’m training CrossFit five times a week. But that it’s a possibility that to reach my goal of gaining muscle mass, I may have to go back to traditional weight lifting. My question is, is it possible to gain a significant amount of lean muscle mass with CrossFit?

1595993585,"Hey fam, 

I’m on my second week of crossfit and I’ve noticed the days we do fancy lifts like overhead presses, snatches and whatever else lol (sorry, still learning the terminology) are the days I feel the most ridiculous and absolutely defeated by the end of class. 

I come from a background with 0 weightlifting experience. Last week, my first week at CrossFit, was the first time in my life I picked up a barbell. I’m hoping this is the reason I’m so bad at nailing the movements.......

Prior to Crossfit I would do moderate exercise: running, yoga, rock climbing, 20 mins of hiit, bodyweight, etc. I never went to a gym to lift before. 

So far I love the training side, the community, and the intensity. I could never work out this hard on my own. Also hoping to see some newbie gains in my figure! But when it comes to the weight lifting, I’m struggling. Physically and mentally. Maybe it’s because I’m a youngish inexperienced girl, I’m over thinking and too hard on myself but man do those lifts just make me feel like I’m out of my league. 

I’m gonna try a different class with a different coach to see if that maybe helps. Part of me just wants to quit and never look back. I’m gonna keep trying and give it my best for 3 months before I decide to quit. 

Any advice or resources for a newbie like me? Please tell me it gets better, lol. Thank you!",crossfit,It’s my second week. How can I stop feeling discouraged by the olympic lifts as an absolute beginner?

First it was consistency with my schedule and diet.

Second, I started trying the macros/nutrition challenges 

Third, cut out supplants and protein.

If I had to guess we probably eat out 3-4 times in a week monday-Sunday and I’m going to the box at least 4 times minimum per week. 

I lost a large amount of weight in my first three months s however since I graduated college and work full-time. I have hit this plateau with Exercise and diet.

I feel stronger and more capable functionally speaking, however I have a lot of body fat and weight I want to lose. Worst thing is my health issues. Low blood sugar, etc. 

Any suggestions other than eating meat, vegetables, fruits and little time no fat? 

Let me just be clear that I have been doing fitness for 5 years straight and went from 315 to 235 within a 2 or 3 year period and now I’m staying afloat at 260-265 depending on the day. Any way to check to see how much is muscle?

1595940634,"Hello,

I've been weightlifting on my own for about 1.5 years now naturally. Focusing on both strength and hypertrophy. Weightlifting is getting quite old by now, not as motivated as before. Missing the social contact and team spirit mainly. Training also seems to become repetitive and rather tedious. Besides weightlifting I also do cardio once in a while. Mainly rowing and running. I am able to run a 13 miles. I do really enjoy a combination of cardio and weightlifting, so I'm interested in what CrossFit has to offer.

My stats are 25M/5'8""ish/66 kg.

I've worked quite hard for my current strength and physique, I've always been small and skinny so it was hard to improve. Here are some stats for some lifts (don't know my 1RM though) just to get an idea:

Bench pressing: 70 kg x 5, can do this for about 2-3 sets.

deadlifting: 100 kg x 5, can do this for about 3 sets.

OHP: 45 kg x 5 for about 3 sets. Can do 50 x 3 for one set.

squat: 100 kg x 5 for about 2 sets, with 90/95 I can finish to 4-5 sets.

Bent over row: 70 kg x 5 for 4 sets.

I was wondering if with CrossFit I'll still be able to gain some strength (I know it won't be as much) and some more muscle mass? Or will I still have to do dedicated weightlifting besides CrossFit? If so, what is a good template to gain some more muscle and strength combined with CrossFit? It seems to be the only thing that is holding me back from trying CrossFit.

I'm not a bodybuilder and I'm not big, but I certainly still want to improve physically. I've included some pictures just to get an idea of my current physique.

It'd be nice to hear some opinions or experiences from people who've been in this position before.

So I had previously posted this because it had met it's $100,000 goal yesterday. Unfortunately, 2 donors seem to have pulled out a few grand each (one had signed up for $2.5k to be an associate producer) which leaves the Kickstarter at just over $98,000 with less than 2 days left ( it wraps up at 1253EST on Wednesday). It wasn't necessary to be promotional about it then.

Adam, the Director went crazy happy as you can see  [https://www.instagram.com/p/CDHn8fPA51I/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDHn8fPA51I/) on Sunday as can be seen.

So if you're a Weightlifter interested in the movie, please support it.

If you ever want to see a CF movie in a threatre mainstream (I got to see EverySecondCounts way back in the day with a crowd of CrossFitters), this movie going mainstream would make a great precedent (Jim Schmitz told me there was a movie way back in the early 70s that was made about WL but I wasn't even thought of back then).

If you want to check out a trailer, this was a trailer shot back in 2015. Things have changed a bit, that song won't be used, obviously the character in the trailer will be a different actor (instead of the director himself to cut down costs at the time).

I couldn't even tell you how or when it happened, my arm just started hurting more and more and finally I decided to take a break until it got better. It's nearly August, I've seen a ton of docs, and it's still not better. Apparently at some point I accumulated a tear in my elbow ligament, a tear in my rotator cuff, and a tear in my bicep.

An alternative is to return the weight to the floor and then change hands. 

Yes, I know the purpose of the exercises is to get the weight/implement to an overhead position. 

1) You’re not completing the entire rep for that arm.
2) On higher rep and grip intensive workouts you’re risking dropping the DB on the exchange. 
3) A dumbbell is not a barbell and these are not near max loads, so no reason to release the weight.

I’ve seen multiple teen athletes on Instagram lifting insane amounts of weight compared to their age, body weight and other (adult) athletes.

Stupid, I know. I recently went through a bad break up (blah blah blah) and generally have felt disappointed in my lack of strength. Regardless of the shitty break up, it's felt like a sort of wake up call for things I've failed to address for a while, particularly my mental and physical well-being. I'm at the point where I'm tired of neglecting my body and mind. I recognize my past lack of self care is/was not sustainable... So here we are at the point that I am 100% committed to a lifestyle change NOT solely a physical change. I'm committed to finding a community that is supportive not only of my physical but also of my mental well-being. I've been an athlete all my life, and as a type-A personality, it is easy for me to become compulsive, competitive, and consumed by my body image and strength performance. What I ultimately want is to find a community or trainer that can help me build my self confidence and overall strength, while promoting GOOD eating habits. I'm not a complete newbie to the movements (front squats, RDLs, Bulgarian Split squats [BARF], etc.). I enjoy these high intensity workouts so I think a CrossFit gym would be helpful?

1595364006,"So I'm a relatively tall guy (around 1.96m or 6'5"") and have been doing CrossFit for about 2 years now, after around 5 years of bodybuilding/isolated weight lifting. When first starting with CF, I had quite a few issues with mobility due to my height and lack of flexibility, but I've managed to improve on that (e.g. do deep squats, proper form cleans, etc.).

However, one thing I am still really struggling with is shoulder mobility. Whenever I have to tilt my torso forward just a little bit in any type of overhead movement, I lose almost all strength and integrity (not sure whether that's the right term). This really shows in OH squats and snatches, but I think it affects my gymnastics as well, as I cannot get a proper full range swing going. Especially single-hand overhead work is really a struggle, more so than overhead barbell work.

I have asked around at different boxes and tried quite a few different type stretches and generally try to involve some form of overhead work in my programming at least once a week, but somehow I'm not seeing real improvement.

I've been a janitor there ever since, cleaning about 3 hours a week. I have my own key, and get to workout whenever I want. It's awesome, however, it made me realize that this pay-format simply is not accessible to most people. 

One of my dreams is to open a box, but I would love to make it accessible to people with low incomes. I've been exploring the idea in my head... I wonder if it would be possible to build some form of sliding membership scale, like, pay what you can, we'll get the difference. Further more, we could ask wealthier members to cover membership costs for members who struggle financially. 

The CrossFit community is so fucking cool and I really think some people I know would jump on a chance to fund a members' journey.

1595247000,"Good morning everyone.  Our equipment is starting to roll in.  Today we are going to start laying down the mats and plywood.   We are looking on advice for the best setup for 2 people to be working out at the same time.

Below are 5 options I have come up with.  It will be mainly myself and my wife at the same time, or anyone else at the office that wants to work out (5 employees total)

Options 3&amp;5 are the least desirable for me since I lose a car space.  It's not the end of the world though if it makes working out a better experience. Options 4 &amp;5 limit my ability to drive the forklift around the center racks in the warehouse unless I remove another section on the end.

With that being said, I am leaning towards either option 2 or 3.  Not sure if the loose deadlift platforms will be worth the hassle of dragging out everytime someone wants to use them.

I will be laying 1 sheet of 3/4"" plywood under the 3/4"" horse mats.  Will this be sufficient (instead of 2 x plywood)?  I am not much of a weight slammer and my wife doesn't do huge weight.  I tried to post in home gym but it did not get approved for some reason.  Seeing how we will be mainly crossfit orientated, this may be a better forum for it anyways.

Any input is greatly appreciated!

**Edited to add this last option.**

I think this is what I am going to go with.  I can pull my rack away from the wall and shift all the cars down.  This will get a nice long path to work out side by side or do lunges.  Plus it's right by the door/garage door so it's easy to run around the building right from lifting.  It will be tighter with the fork lift and cars, but I don't lose any vehicle or desk space.

I'm 36 and have seen 2 surgeons who say I need a partial shoulder replacement due to arthritis. One surgeon doesn't recommend it yet due to my young age, the other says I'm not too young. Since the replacement only lasts about 10 years, it seems too early to do it but at my current pain and mobility level I can only do modified crossfit workouts which is no fun and not worth the money honestly.

1595036820,"I have been part of the CrossFit community since retiring from the Navy in 2017.  I became addicted.  To the movements, people, community, and lifestyle.  My life was reinvented.  I quit the job I hated, found a job I loved, completed my second college degree, made new lifelong friends, and competed multiple local box competitions. 

That brings me to last week.   We were completing the Nicole benchmark.  I subbed out the running for 1mile Echo Bike (because it was there) and was doing 10 pull-ups per round, not trying to kill it, just wanted to maintain.  While doing my 4 round, my grip slipped.  I don’t know what happened after that except that the back of my head hit the floor.  

According to the coach, the sound of my head hitting the floor was louder than the music.  I was out for about a minute.  I woke, but I do not remember anything until standing next to my gym bag.  Multiple friends asked to drive me to the hospital and home, I shot down every request like a fool (I have since apologized.)

I drove to work, and then the local ER.  They gave me a CT scan and told me that I have a 4 inch crack in the back of my skull, a minor bleed, and bruising on the brain.  An overnight stay and another CT determined that the bleed had stopped, but I was kept for 3 more days for observation.  

It has been a week since my release.  I have treatment scheduled for the local TBI clinic and Occupational Therapy. 

There are OK days and bad days.  No good one yet.  The world is a weird fog sometimes.  My heart aches for those who I have affected negatively because of this (family, coach, friends, gym owner/manager.)

I know I should listen to the doctors, but is there anything that I can do in the meantime, in terms of exercise?  This is one of the toughest mountains that I have had to climb and I could use the advice.  I owe it to those closest to me to come out of this stronger and smarter.  

Thank you!",crossfit,Cracked skull and CrossFit.

1595013012,"I could use some home programming advice, please!  I did a few months of CF at the box near me until COVID, home a couple months just doing bodyweight stuff and whatever I could do with the pair of 25lb dumbbells and the 16kg kettlebell I had until the gym opened back up.  Was fun getting back into it a month, and instead of just doing the 'newbie' stuff that was mostly like any other HIIT bootcamp, we started adding in a barbell strength portion everyday (seemed to be Floor Press, Deadlift, Front or Back Squat, Hang Power Clean and then maybe DB Snatches or Lunges on the 5th day each week).  I noticed myself getting stronger at those, since I hadn't tried much of that since being at a traditional gym.  But now I'm back at home, waiting to see what happens with gyms and covid.  I'm expecting I'm home awhile, so now I've got a squat rack with spotter arms and a bench, more weight than I can deadlift, jump rope, heavier dumbbells and a heavier kettlebell on the way, a slam ball and a wall ball.  I got a little crazy and grabbed a rower and a bike, both on the way as well, thinking even when the gym is back open, I'd like to do supplemental stuff at home since the open gym hours don't work at all with my real life schedule.

My goals are simple - get stronger while getting leaner and improving my endurance (I've noticed my resting heart rate and active recovery were improving the first few months at the gym).

My stats - 155lb male, middle-age, can't run long distances anymore but can do 200m and 400m runs down the block, vegetarian, take protein shakes daily to compensate - 5RMs -&gt; 195lb Deadlift, 135 Back Squat (probably higher but will try tomm), 125 Bench, all pretty lightweight honestly.  11-12% body fat last time I got an Inbody back in Feb, I'm sure the same or a little lower now.  My belief is I want to get that down &lt;10% to get the more toned look I'm hoping for, since I can see the muscles are there from putting in a lot of work, but I'm also still at 'beginner' lift weights, so I don't really know whether putting in more cardio on the bike+rower and keeping up the metcons for the endurance/heart is a good thing, or going to make it hard for me to lift any heavier.

What I've been doing is following along with the gym's WOD since I stopped going in, so there's a short warmup, then a strength portion of 1 lift (let's say 4x5 or 7-5-3-7-5-3 or whatever) each day, and then a metcon.  If I don't have the listed equipment, I sub in something, and since I don't want to run long distances, I've been subbing in stuff like KB snatches for some of those until more gear shows up.  Since I'm not spending the time talking to people and listening to a coach that I would in the gym, I'm finding that all goes by quickly, so I'm adding in a second lift or some stretching or I'll lookup a ""Core WOD"" and throw that on the end to get me to a full 1 hour.

That's more than I intended to write, but there it is - I would super appreciate programming advice as far as to keep increasing the weight while not losing out on metcons and what I get from the cardio (there's heart disease and diabetes in the family history, so I' working hard to avoid all that).  While I'm working from home for the foreseeable future while covid is out there, I'm not even above continuing my early morning garage workouts, and then doing supplemental work in the evening (I was picturing myself spending 20 minutes doing tabatas or whatever on the bike or rower each day).

1. ""I don't think you need the 14-pound wall ball anymore."" Ha. Minor, but this nudge to step-up to the 20# wall balls (which was programmed as RX for most of our work), was a breakthrough for me to begin pushing myself and stop settling for what I had gotten comfortable doing.
2. ""You've really come a long way."" Just to hear that about six months into my journey, unsolicited after a workout from a coach I respect ... I just nodded and said thanks ... but, hell, with all the struggles I'd been through inside and outside the realm of CrossFit ... it meant the world.

1594711413,"So I think I should elaborate a bit before I go into the main issue of the subject - 

I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with fitness. It is both a blessing and a curse, especially considering that I have never really considered myself to be the athletic or the jock type.

And unfortunately, I have a bit of a history when it comes to fitness - years ago (10 years ago) I unfortunately have gone through an eating disorder and despite that I managed to find a way to overcome the demons of said mental disorder, the temptations and demons are still continuously larking in the back of my mind, tempting me to go back to my old ways especially when I get serious about fitness where the issue of discipline, counting macros and following a plan as it is a tricky process of trying to be aware where you are jumping between the realm of discipline/passion or the realm of unhealthy obssession because the line that divides the two are pretty blurry.

At the same time, fitness has helped me a lot - throughout all of my life, I have gone through many, many, many unfortunate events - trauma, PTSD, depression, anxiety and so on.

And fitness, through the idea of mental toughness, discipline, and pure raw willpower, has helped me to slowly embody these traits of self-assurance, confidence and mental strength. 

But at the same time, much like everyone else, it can be tricky to find the right motivation and discipline to push through and even find the motivation to go to the gym early or find the time to work out despite the pressures of life (work, school, personal stuff, family, etc) especially myself where I constantly have to battle against obstacles of mental health issues that block my path towards peak mental focus (I practice mindfulness and take therapy so they do help even though they involve their own challenges).

And fitness, despite its benefits, is not an easy task. 

Persisting through the sheer pain and fatigue makes me feel like a rock and the feeling of endorphins pumping my veins make me feel tough and masculine. But it is very mentally demanding, especially crossfit, because I need a little bit of time to mentally prepare myself to be as focused as possible to avoid injury, exhaustion and so on.

And whenever I think of fitness, I have this impression that I swore an ""oath"" of sorts - the desire to continue despite the pressure, the willpower to persist despite the overwhelming obstacles, the strength to overcome whatever challenges that come in your way, mental or physical. 

And going through the mentally demanding tasks of persisting through own personal mental challenges and the challenges of life is not an easy task to have enough energy and enthusiasm to work out as well. Sometimes, I am awfully careful of whether I am working out because I want to or because I have to (reminiscent to my dark ED days).

I have only started working out for about 4 weeks (and I know that noticing changes takes time) and I have already been feeling mentally fatigued and as though my mind is overwhelmed with the challenges of my heart and soul. Some days I manage to overcome the psychologically draining nature of depression and anxiety, other times, the challenge is so overwhelming that I decide to skip the workout for another day because I felt that I do not have enough strength.

But lately, I have been skipping a lot of workouts - the challenge to mentally prepare myself is becoming too much and I do not want to risk injuring myself and then I end up in another crossroad - whether skipping a workout or taking a break is a good thing or whether I taking the path of the easy way out and cowardice. 

It makes me feel guilty to take the second path but I somehow feel deep in my gut that I do not take it, I might risk making myself worse in the long run or worse, finding it hard to focus on working out while dividing my energy on keeping my mind focused and undistracted at the same time (it happens).

&amp;#x200B;

It is a mentally demanding task to keep up all of this and these tricky crossroads happen to me all the time. But now, the challenge of pushing myself to go to the gym despite the challenges is proving to be too much and despite that, I often deliberately choose not to go to the gym out of the fear of taking the risk but I deep down feel guilty nonetheless as though I broke my promise to continue to push through despite the obstacles.

&amp;#x200B;

So aside of all this - aside of the overly complicated story that I just told, when is it the right time to purposefully to be a break from working out?",crossfit,Honest question - when is it the right time to take a break from working out despite the overwhelming desire to continue because of the desire to stay disciplined?

1594672056,"Hello redditors,
First of all thanks for the time you will take to answer my basic questions.
I looked other post but can’t find what I’m actually looking for.
It’s 2 years that I’m practicing crossfit, first year was only for fun a few days a week. Then I got addicted to it.
It’s been 1 year till I started practicing with more focus and some clear goal on mind. Still a beginner, I’m still missing a lot of exercises, like muscle up, pistol, handstand walk and a few other that I’m not remembering at the moment for sure! (Hello double unders!)

Some weeks before the quarantine I got a barbell with 100kg of plates and some gymnastic rings. I have more or less all the basic equipment, missing the rower (really expensive) but hopefully I will have it in 2-3 months.

I would like to find a programming who can support me in developing all the necessaries skills to be decent at crossfit, I need to submit video of me executing skills, a program to develop the missing skills, and also a program who can give me some clear numbers (ex. Amrap power clean with 50% of your 1rm). So I can focus myself on testing my 1rm for a few skills and then working with those. But I’m not sure to be able to work at my best by deciding myself the weight and so on.

I’m 31, and my goal is to be able to partecipate in some easy competition for the beginner category and have some fun, it’s not my work, but I can dedicate at least 2hrs a day to it and I love the fun and the progress I am already seeing.

Any suggestion is more then welcome.

My gym is finally reopening in a few weeks and per my county mandate, masks must be worn while exercising inside (they are going to have outdoor options in the parking lot with distancing so hopefully I can do that too). I was just wondering for those of you who are already back at the gym if there are certain kinds or brands of masks you find to be comfortable or at least bearable to wear while working out. Additionally, no cardio is allowed so I’m guessing the workouts will be strength training and form/skill work based, so I won’t be sucking wind in the mask. Any tips or advice greatly appreciated!!",crossfit,Masks while working out

In the spirit of the handstand walk trend going on, this was my 15 seconds of fame at the 2016 CrossFit Team Regionals. For context: I have a background in breakdancing and so I've been handstand walking long before I started CrossFit. This style of walking tends to be a little bit faster, but is a little more fatiguing on the shoulders (and frankly, more fun)

From what I hear they made a rule right after this to say you can't do this anymore which doesn't make sense since it doesn't make the walk any easier or harder to judge, but (shrug).

1594275440," Hi guys!  
I have been working out at home/back yard for the last three months now. I like to keep my workouts as intense as possible and without the supervision of an experienced trainer apparently, I am very prone to hurt myself.  
I have been experiencing knee pain for the last two weeks now; I haven't exactly stopped leg work, went to the lower impact side of things (I normally love my HIIT workouts -with a lot of jumping). And even though to a lesser degree, I still have the pain there.  
I will see a doctor tomorrow about this but I am nine months in my fitness routine, I have been through smaller issues and a kinda bad back pain and I went through them just fine. What I want to know is whether it's normal to have occasional tiny injuries without them turning into long-term damage? Does anyone with a longer experience in the area can vouch for that? Or am I doing something horribly wrong?  
The other thing is, it really bummed me out, the idea of an injury has ruined me for the last two weeks. I like getting stronger and getting better and I like doing it better than other people. I like the idea that I can push myself further than other people even care to try. I like the concept of putting my sweat and my blood into what I do. And I am afraid a steady and slower concept is a must for staying injury-free. Like, I am careful with my form, my trainers always approved of it too but I also try doing things that I cannot do until I can do them. Which basically means not being ""totally"" in control of my body's positioning in unfamiliar exercises and shaky landings in explosive movements and stuff like that. And I always thought it was okay, my body would be able to handle that bit of error. Can it not?

1594219332,"TL;DR - relatively new to crossfit, really fatigued in evenings after early morning WODs, but I'm trying hard to do the right things.

\-------

I ""started"" CrossFit in March after strictly lifting for about 4-5 months at my local big-box. There's quotes around ""started"" because I literally got through the basics introductory classes to go through core movements etc. and then attended my first official class at the beginning of March. The day after my first class, all the gyms were closed due to the pandemic. I'm your average looking guy with little muscle tone, but relatively healthy. Not new to fitness, but picking it back up this year. Used to strictly run a lot in college, sports in high school, etc.

During the closed time, I continued to support my gym with my membership, and our owner programmed and sent us daily workouts to perform (he let me borrow a 20lb. DB and 35lb. KB based on my beginner skill level and strength). I did 3-4 of those WOD-style home workouts per week and complemented that with regular pull-up sessions and dubs practice with my rope.

My gym re-opened day after Memorial Day (May 26) and I hit the ground running, excited to *really* get started. Unfortunately, I've found myself just incredibly fatigued in the evenings (6-7pm) of my workout days to the point that I don't really want to get up the next day for the early class. **Does my body just need to ""get used to"" this level of intensity?**

I've been going 3x per week to the 6AM class. These are WODs that I enjoy for the variety, usually consisting of a strength piece followed by a MetCon piece. I know others who go 5x-6x per week who are older, seem to have relatively the same level of fitness as I do, and I'd like to go more if possible.

**Me:**

6'3 Male, 190lb., 29 yrs.

**Diet:** 

* Prior to a workout, I'll have a Huel mix: 1 scoop Huel, 1/2 cup coffee, and a splash of milk.
* Post-workout, some kind of recovery drink (O2, Gatorade)
* Breakfast (8:15AM), usually a bagel w/ spread, banana, cup of coffee
* Lunch (noon), leftovers from dinner yesterday, fairly diverse things like: pasta dishes, rice stir fry dishes, fish, tacos/fajitas, casseroles, normal homemade dishes usually incorporating at least some veggies with protein.
* Dinner (6PM), see lunch
* Water: at least 100fl. oz. per day, most times more on days I work out.

**Sleep:**

* Nights before workouts, I go to bed between 10PM and 10:30PM
* I wake up at 5:15AM on workout days
* Nights before rest days, I go to bed between 10:30PM and 11:30PM
* I wake up at 7:30AM on rest days
* Naps seem to not be an option for me. They make me feel terrible when I wake up, and it takes me a good amount of time to fall asleep for one anyways.

**Other Recovery:**

* I use the GOWOD app (focus posterior chain)
* I do the post-wod roll (8min) and and daily flow stretches (15min) on workout days
* I do the daily flow stretches (15min) on rest days
* I try to do some light jump rope active recovery on rest days

**Lifestyle:**

* I have a desk job, so I'm rather sedentary for 8+ hrs. per day outside of my gym activities

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate anyone's help; I'm really trying hard. I wouldn't normally vomit out all this info, but I've been experimenting with a bunch of different variables with little change in my fatigue levels in the evenings. I know it's entirely possible that I've only been doing this ""full-time"" for 1.5months and that my body isn't adjusted yet. Just wanted to poll the community.

I'm (30F) \~160, 5'8 with better flexibility/mobility than hubby, but have the grace of a drunken baby giraffe so you can imagine how well that bodes when things aren't quite clicking at the gym...

1594122453,"I've been thinking lately about building a shed in my side parkway and the attached picture shows the space available to do such a thing.. Since my gym closed down mid March, I've been buying my own equipment to continue training at home. I got a barbell, weights, squat rack, pull up bar and a couple of dumbbells and kettlebells, then later built a plyo box.

The attached picture shows that after building the shed I will install a pull-up rig on the ground and get rid of the separate pull-up bar and squat rack as the pull-up bar is wall mounted and i doubt the shack walls can handle it.

I currently workout in the same area the shed will be but without any walls or constrains so I'm freely moving. So my main question here is: will the area in front of the rig be enough for Oly lifting? I know it's going to be hard to do bar facing burpees as the bar will not fit sideways but this is the best community to find out flaws in my design and tell me what i'll be missing out on..

I don't have the vertical space for rings to work on my muscle-ups or install a rope to climb but that's not a problem at the moment.

Generally I could kick up and get close-ish to the wall, maybe tap it with one foot, but never get straight up.

1594048508,"Okay long story short, I started at my box in September and I was 1-2-1 x3 a week until December. I started of so small because I have a chronic back injury, dyspraxia, hypermobility and I'm overweight not to mention a whacky drug cocktail to manage all of it. But then I fell in love with crossfit, I could do it, eg I started by doing step ups on a 10kg weight so what a few inches high? Then built up to the boxes, then weighted with boxes. I lost 1.5st and dropped two dress sizes from the exercise alone.

I am so grateful to my box I joined classes full time in december and did the 2 Christmas workouts carried on happily until march and lockdown, went into it doing home workouts but gradually lost motivation my dog would go ballistic and I'd be too noisy for those I live with so lost my mojo I'd started worrying I'd have lost all my progress and my embarrassment was making me feel like giving up. But instead I started walking more and more I walked 230miles since lockdown started and I started a keto diet. I realised I missed crossfit and decided I wanted to stick to it knowing it would be hard.

And today I did my first session AND overhead barbell work and managed the whole thing including the hellish final 15 minutes workout. I managed better than I did before lockdown actually and it feels so good despite my thighs being on fire. I feel I've finally committed and my life style is miles better.

Pretty new to CrossFit and this page :) 

I was wondering if anybody has any recommendations of good boxes in London? (I am moving flat soon so relatively open, but would prefer something in either the south east or west) 

Context:
- joined a box on a foundation month in March which was cut three weeks in due to COVID. Have since been continuing to pay monthly support but have decided that I won’t be going back based on a few reasons (lack of communication being the core issue)
- looking to find a box where there is a good level of coaching and ideally at least a few of the members compete at a good level (to learn from and eventually go to competitions with)
- would be looking to work on skill as much as possible, therefore would hope that the programming isn’t purely based on killing yourself every session and  has a reasonable amount of open gym time to perfect skills

1605889339,"Full disclosure: I was, am, and will always be a Westside Barbell fanboy.  I started lifting in 1999, and when I started “researching” on the internet, the ONLY way to train for strength was to “do Westside Barbell”, so that’s what I grew up with and it will always hold a special place in my heart.  Because of that, when I saw that Louie Simmons had released a 306 page book detailing his life and the story of Westside Barbell AND that it was on sale, I legit just pulled out a credit card and paid whatever it cost to have.  Along with that, having followed Louie for so long, I’m VERY familiar with his particular brand of insanity as it relates to writing and speaking, so I was able to look past a lot of things in this book that will most likely be completely unbearable to a new reader.


All that said, let me start with the conclusion: if you’re NOT a fan of Westside barbell, I’d skip this book.  This is pure fan service: going into drama, behind the scenes stuff, crazy stories, stats, facts and figures.  Hardcore powerlifting fans, and specifically those of Westside, will get a kick out of it, but those that are just fans of lifting in general hoping to “learn from the master” aren’t going to get much for the price point.  There is SOME gold in this regarding training for powerlifting, but you gotta mine the hell out of the book to find it.


That said, I read the whole thing in 3 days of casual reading.  It’s an easy read and I found it pretty enjoyable.  Because Louie is so scatterbrained, it actually makes the book well paced, because Louie will start on a boring subject but out of nowhere tell a story about a guy kidnapping a dog and getting 100 days in jail before switching back to talking about band tension calculations.  It keeps you on your toes.


Below are the notes I took as I read the book, to give you an idea of what I was thinking/feeling at the time.  Enjoy!

---

* Written all on the third person: Louie’s alter ego talking about Louie.

* Written in Louie’s delightfully insane “steam of consciousness” writing/speaking style.  If you’re unfamiliar with it, it will be jarring.  If you’re familiar with it, it will still be jarring, but you’ll be used to it.

* Holy hell, Louie does a subtle callout of Ironmind early in the writing: accuses them of stealing the idea of the “magic circle” and Super Squats.   As a rabid Ironmind AND Westside Fanboy, I’m vexed.

* In general, Louie doesn’t go easy on anyone in the book.  He’ll praise people for strengths and speak matter* of* factly about their weaknesses (so and so was a bad squatter, so and so never did well in the sport and went on to become a ref, etc etc).  When I went to Kaz’s seminar, it was very similar.  Don’t know if this is a generational thing, a “being one of the greatest of all time” thing, a “I’m too damn old to worry about being nice” thing, or just a thing, but it’s honestly pretty cool to have no doubt about the thoughts of the author.

* Louie’s “The Ball or the Sword” story gives the reader a solid understanding of why he is the way he is.  The quote “Louie believes that if a powerlifter doesn’t want to invest his or her life into powerlifting, he or she shouldn’t waste their time” is why he uses the methods he uses.  It’s also why he’s so into unlimited ply, and only cares about the biggest numbers period dot: because THAT is powerlifting.  It’s not about who is the best with an asterisk (raw, under 40, 2 hour weigh in, drug tested, etc etc), but simply who can put up the most.

* Louie’s age shows primarily in the things he thinks are acceptable to write.  If you are sensitive to social issues, it’s most likely not going to go over well for you.  I’m 73 pages in, and have encountered one homophobic slur (not said by Louie, but relayed by him as something one lifter said to another) and his advocacy of “Lucha Underground where men beat the hell out of the hot women; it’s twice the fun.” I’m old enough that I “get” his generation, and after reading Dick Marcinko’s “Rogue Warrior” I doubt anything an author writes can be offensive to me at this point, but it may be jarring to other readers.

* “but Louie, in 1982, would not read any scientific studies from an American author.” Man can I dig that.  Paul Kelso was speaking illy of the state of exercise science in the 80s in “Powerlifitng Basics Texas Style” as well.  

* “Louie first found the importance of the Dynamic Method. Most lifters divided training days from heavy to light. But strength is measured in velocities, not heavy or light. Instead, it is measured by fast, intermediate, or slow.” I feel real stupid for having not thought of it like that before.  And part of that is most likely because I’m not a speedy lifter to begin with.  

* Louie is unapologetic in how much he despises how US Weightlifters are being trained these days.  The topic comes up a LOT in the book.  I imagine it’s a result of him coming from a weightlifting background: we never forget our first love.  I am so vocally against powerlifting these days, and it’s because that’s where I started and it’s rough for me to see the state it’s in right now.  Of course, I’ve also said that we do so poorly in weightlifting that we may as well give Louie the reigns and see what happens, but I am a fan of chaos.

* Louie misspells the names of a lot of lifters in the book.  Just ran across “Glen Pendley”, and I know I’ve seen more throughout the book.

* “but that the real key was the special single* joint exercises.” People don’t get this about Westside.  They think it’s just DE and ME, but that’s only 20% of the training.  EIGHTY PERCENT is Repetition Effort.  THAT is where the magic happens.

* “Producing the rule book and training qualified referees were the key focus of the IPF. Louie did not agree that an IPF qualified referee status could be achieved in two months of studying a rule book when it took three to five years to be an Elite level lifter” Love it

* “To this day, Louie believes that if an athlete is subject to being tested, then everyone connected to the federation should be checked, including refs, spotters, officials, meet directors, and the guy who collects the door money.” Also love it.

* “Also, the IPF had drug testing, and lots of people were opposed to having their civil rights invaded” as a political science guy, this stuff always bugs me.  Your civil rights cannot be violated by a private organization: only the government can violate your rights.
  
* There’s a whole section on federation drama, if you’re into that.  Oh powerlifting.

* “It is hard for Louie to understand why powerlifters bad mouth each other instead of uniting together” ok, that is a comical lack of self* awareness given how the book has gone so far.

* Nice to see Louie write positively on Chuck V.  Their relationship was strained for a while, but seems to be in a good place.  And really, anything written about Chuck is awesome.  He’s a goddamn sasquatch in all ways, because along with being huge and scary, there’s SO little out there about him, because he doesn’t talk.

* I’m at a part in the book where Louie talks about a buddy of his throwing his food on the floor at a restaurant and assaulting the cooks because they put onions in his food.  This is one of many stories of downright psychopathy.  I can’t tell if Louie attracts these kinds of people, or if there are just more of these folks out there than I realize.

* Tons of stories start with “so and so knew a 13/14/15 year old kid that was really strong and he started lifting at Westside and etc etc”.  I find it a little off putting how so many of these adult men are just hanging out with these teenage boys.  And maybe it just shows how uninvolved I am with my local community, but it just feels weird reading it so much.

* “Ryan Cannelie” for Ryan Kennelly.  Ok, this book was clearly never edited or proofread. 

* I feel like someone may have tried to help Louie at the start of the book and then eventually gave up, because around page 135 or so Louie’s rambling style of writing really starts to take off.  Again: if you’re familiar with it, it’s not bad, but if this is your first exposure to how Louie presents ideas, you’re in for a ride.

* All criticism aside (so far), I’m 165 pages in and all I can think is “This is what ‘Westside vs the World’ SHOULD have been”

* “a bodybuilder is at his or her weakest and smallest at contest time. In contrast, however, a powerlifter is at his or her strongest and biggest at contest time.” That’s honestly a pretty interesting revelation.  Something to be said about the razor’s edge of health/performance a powerlifter is on for a meet peak though.  

* “Sue came to Westside overweight. She wanted to powerlift to get into shape. Most of the time, this does not work” I hope people are taking goddamn notes here!  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen a 300+lber start lifting to “get in shape” and then put on a bunch more bodyweight because they’re “naturally talented” at heavy lifting.  No dude: you have mass, and mass moves mass.  You started exercising to get healthy: get healthy, THEN put on mass.

* “Also, normal people can only give you normal results.”* DING DING DING.  People are in such a rush to normalize things, but that’s the whole point: you gotta be and do things differently to achieve different results.

* “He thought it would take a weight gain to do it, so Louie pushed up the volume and added more calories.”* Straight from the master’s mouth folks.  Quit trying to bulk on Starting Strength: up the volume, up the calories.

* The “Nightrider” section is brutal.  Just a long list of callouts by Louie on former Westsiders.

* Don’t skim the book, because Louie’s crazy mind throws things in at random spots.  The section on Chuck V under world record squatters suddenly turns into a seminar on how bands work.

* Louie throws some shade at EliteFTS, clarifying that they are separate businesses.  It’s gotta be tough to be Louie’s friend I am sure.

* Louie writes that he will never watch “Westside vs the World”.  Good call Louie.

* It was heartwarming to see how positively Louie speaks of Jim Wendler.  

* Page 214 and now the homophobic slur IS coming directly from Louie.  It’s a quote from the 90s, and I get times were different, but still, it just takes a book that reads like a kindly old man retelling stories from the past and puts a lot of ugliness in it in short order.

* Louie refers to Dave Hoff as the strongest geared lifter of all time, which is honestly a shock for Louie.  I’m used to him not differentiating between gear and raw, just referring to lifters as lifters.  Wonder if he’s finally gotten sick enough of the politics to feel the need to clarify at this point.

* Some of these stories about Westside personalities are just painful to get through.   Helpful reminder that being a good lifter doesn’t mean being a good person.  Often, it can even be necessary to not be one to be the other.  This is a selfish hobby.

* I remember in 07 when I wanted to “Do Westside Barbell training” and the common question was “can I still do it if I don’t have a GHR/reverse hyper”, and guys like Tate and Wendler would say you don’t need that stuff and would offer up old school movements like GHRs and RDLs and back extensions.  But when you read this book, you realize just how important all the crazy crap Louie developed is for the success of Westside.  And yeah, Westside may have STARTED with just the basics, but it’s clearly evolved, and the idea that you can follow the program without all the specialty equipment is really getting silly now.  20% of the training is ME/DE, and the rest is all super specialized bodybuilder work.

* “For some odd reason, lots of Louie’s friends go to jail” at least Louie is aware this is weird.

* “The Curse” is an awesome section of the book that describes why Louie will set out to help anyone in the world of lifting.  Very touching.

* So far the last half of the book is basically Louie listing names of people and lifts that they did/how those lifts improved while training at Westside.  This is pretty typical Louie Simmons stuff.  His articles are all like this too.  What’s crazy is Louie will screw up the spelling of the name of someone he’s known for 25 years but will know down to the POUND how much that person squatted at a meet in 1996.

* Louie advises a rubgy coach to have his players wrestle in the off* season to cut down in season injuries.  Goddamn do I love that suggestion/solution.  

* I’m on page 273 of 306 and the book is just running completely off the rails.  Any semblance of organization is gone, and it’s just Louie finding jumping off points to rant about people and things.  Which isn’t to say that it’s not entertaining, but again, for those that prefer structure: you won’t find it here.

* Ok, now the homophobic slur isn’t a quote from the 90s or a quote from someone else.  Come on Louie.

* There’s a story about a lifter not knowing what order a powerlifting meet runs in (as far as order of lifts) and then going on to set a pro total.  There’s a lesson there about how being super academic about your sport probably doesn’t matter as much as simply being strong.

* So many of Louie’s stories about lifters end with “they died much too young”.  Probably something to take away from that.

* Last 10 pages of the book are an excellent example of the need for competition in powerlifting in order to get stronger.  It can’t just be going against a spreadsheet.  Competing against a real human drives us to get stronger.  Also, at the very end, it says Louie banned all the members of the night crew of Westside for life, which included Dave Hoff.

[Meet Video here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHv4EinpGnG/)

Squats 2/3  
\- 255kg/562lbs walking backwards is hard, lost balance a lot of times. Nah lift  
\- 255kg/562lbs walking backwards is still hard, but didn’t lose balance. Solid lift  
\- 265kg/585lbs kinda figured out one plane of bipedal locomotion. Also these are the best wrap jobs I’ve ever had it felt like little coozies. Solid lift.  

  
Bench 2/3  
\- 190kg/418lbs Lol. Solid lift.  
\- 200kg/440lbs came off the chest straight instead of back. Still gucci. Solid lift.  
\- 205kg/452lbs back cramped. Nah lift.   

  
Deadlift 1/3  
\- 272.5kg/600lbs switched to sumo in warm ups and it was slappin, proceeded by the fastest I’ve ever touched 600. Solid lift  
\- 287.5kg/633lbs this was to be a “two tries at qualifying for Kern” (505 Wilks) type attempt and it moved at a speed I definitely didn’t expect, a reverse position over power situation and I basically flew back, and did my best Jim face into the camera, 660lbs was the next attempt. Nah lift but I got another shot at it amirite.  
\- 287.5kg/633lbs got it up and all, focused more on position bc knew the strength was there, waited for the down command but by the time I got it the ends of the bar were over my heels and my momentum carrying me back. So at this point straight down is over my knees/quads, I do my best to get out of the way while keeping my feet glued and holding onto the bar, spotter wasn’t helping my case here for not falling back but it is what it be. Nah lift.   

  
Thoughts: Excited and frustrated. Accomplished April’s goals, missed the “oh heck this is going better than I thought” goals. Didn’t have any grinders so feel pretty solid, throw it in the fuck it bucket call it a tune up meet I’m 3 weeks out again for one more at bat in Kansas City with Bridgeford and Generation Strength.

1605117470,"The term ""raw"" get's used a bit loosely in my opinion. If you can't brace enough to squat a certain weight, you have no business squatting it. I think the reason some people get more out of a belt than other is simply the lack of bracing strength.  Wraps for bench, same deal, mummy'ing up the wrists almost takes them out of the equation to some extent. I get that people want to see higher and higher numbers, but I feel like the records get lost as equipment gets better. I for one would LOVE to see a powerlifting meet where only chalk and shoes were allowed. I guess you could argue completely raw to be bare feet and no chalk, but for the purpose of this discussion let's say those are allowed.   
Powerlifting has different equipment levels as it is, so why not ""completely raw""?

Currently 6'1 222-224 lbs and I've been training in general for a while doing typical LA fitness style workouts and playing basketball. I've been training powerlifting style for about 2.5 years now. My numbers are respectable but I'm not breaking any records or competitive by anyone's standards I just really enjoy the process and doing my best to beat my old numbers. 

I've competed before at 93kg and the start of the pandemic I was sitting at like 210-212. Spent hella time building a home gym and have been training my ass off enjoying it since like July/August. 

Squat PR went from 420-&gt;445.
DL PR went up a few lbs to 455
Bench went from 245-&gt; 285.

Overall not bad. BUT, I'm fuckin weighing in at 222 now and I have been somewhat trying to lose weight. I don't particularly like how I feel at this weight and I've always told myself I want to ""get lean"" just to see how I feel/look/challenge myself to do it. 

I don't over indulge or eat out really and a typical day for me would be about 2,500-2,800 calories. I cut that down to 2,220 calories and still see no movement on scale and still don't like the feeling of the body. 

Any tips on how to tip the scales (pun intended) in my favor more? I'm completely familiar with macros, training, caloric everything, but I still can't seem to unlock the key. Given my natural size I can't fathom that I need to go LOWER than 2,200 calories to begin to lean out. 

TLDR; intermediate lifter, 6'1 224 lbs getting stronger but wanting to lose weight. Can't seem to unlock the key. Knowledgeable about nutrition. Any tips would help.",powerlifting,Getting stronger....but unfortunately gaining weight...all tips welcomed.

1604959590," So I'm currently dealing with some tendinitis in my right quad. I have  knee issues from old sports injuries so I'm used to taking time off  periodically, but I'm wondering if there would be any benefit to doing  lighter squats as long as there's no pain. Currently my max is a little  over 400 and I'd be doing like 150 tops at the most with higher reps. Is  it possible to make progress in terms of size and strength, or should I  just shut it down completely until I can get back to lifting heavy?",powerlifting,Are light squats worth it?

Anyway, when I’ve been deadlifting I get the later reps of my set and the first thing to stop me from getting the next rep is actually my left hand. My grip strength is holding me back more than my glutes or hamstrings. Also when my reps are finished the joints in my fingers are usually in pain, which I’m not sure if it’s normal. If my left hand wasn’t giving out it feels like I could get a solid 2+ more reps in, so I’m wondering what I can do to fix this/ improve my grip.

As of the moment, I don't feel any imbalance while doing my lifts without any equipment/belt so I don't think I need any, but what about when I get to heavier weights? I've seen people deadlift/squat 4 plates with a belt. I've also seen people do 5 or 6 plates raw.

1604519926,"I was just spectating someone I know in the Marines who powerlifts competitively as she was squatting and locking her knees everytime. I was confused and concerned at this bc I was pretty sure locking your knees during an extensive motion was known to be dangerous, especially if you're an athlete. Seems like common knowledge. She just told me that it is apparently required to lock your knees on squats or they do not count. I do not know how powerlifting competitions are structured, but that sounds taboo to me.

Knee injuries caused by stress on the joints and ligaments are among the most common serious injuries in most athletes, whether you're lifting, playing football or basketball, or whatever. Virtually any sport, and if not an immediate injury, you'll face discomfort overtime as seen in most retired athletes.

A common red flag for virtually anyone with access to a gym or a squat bar being a requirement at the competitive level seems highly irresponsible, and above all outdated. Is this actually a requirment in powerlifting, and for fucks sake, why??",powerlifting,Why is it required in competition to lock your knees on squats despite it being well known that doing so is very dangerous

So  now I've been lifting 135lbs for the past few session, training 4 sets  very close to failure each time (I don't really count RPE but around RPE  9-9.5 for all sets) but haven't been able to even increase my total  amount of reps by 1 (Training 1: 8-6-6-7, Training 2: 6-8-6-4,  Training3: 8-8-6-7, Training 4: 8-6-5-5), it feels more like I am  getting a tiny bit weaker each session instead of getting stronger, the  weight feeling a bit heavier each time, especially after the first set.

I  am eating at a surplus of around 200-300 calories, sleeping 8-9 hours  each night, eating 1g/lb protein/bodyweight and training 3 times a week  full body with my chest training consisting of 4 sets of 6-8 reps on the  barbell bench press.

Me stalling  on the bench press is just an example, I am stalling on other lifts  aswell, on others I am progressing for example the squat where I am  adding 5lbs every session (2 times a week) but I feel like that is only  the case because my squat is really weak and I am actually stronger than  I thought (was aiming for 4x6 and was able to complete the last set  with 10 reps).

Correct me if I am  wrong, but wouldn't the only possible reason for me not getting stronger  (almost getting weaker) be a lack of recovery/adaption to the training I  am doing? It isn't really possible for me to just ""try harder"" when I  am already working so close to failure, sure I could be feeling ""off""  during one of those workouts, but I literally haven't gotten one bit  stronger after 4 sessions and my weight on the bench press is still in  the beginner range. I also don't feel like adding in even more sets  would help.

Most full body  beginner routines Ive seen prescribe 3x5 or 5x5 of bench press every  other session (so 1.5 times a week), I went with 4x6-8 because a few  more reps feel easier on my joints and even after doing 4 sets I don't  feel sore at all the next day. Doing bench 3 times a week because I  currently can't OHP.

Correct me if  I'm wrong but to me the most logical thing seems like removing one set  (so 3x6-8), working not as close to failure, benching less frequently or  simply eating more to boost recovery if I want to continue getting  stronger.

I won't be able to train  with heavy weights for the next month anyway since my country is  getting another lockdown but I will try improving my recovery once I get  back to the gym to see if I can get stronger that way.

What  do you think could be the issue? Do you agree with my thought process?  What else could cause me to get stronger if not a lack of recovery?",powerlifting,"Lack of progress, am I ""overtraining""?"

I am a student who started powerlifting fairly recently (6 months) and am ow experiencing the gyms closing down again due to covid 19. I am the proud possessor of 2 10kg dumbells, and a training mat. But I was wondering what would be the best way to try and maintain as much of my strength during this, for now, unknown time period. I would assume that strength training is impossible using low weight, but surely there must be ways to preserve as much as possible. I myself was thinking to go and do high volume bodyweight and try to make the exercises as hard as possible using variations, but would love to hear more experienced people's opinion!

Tore my ACL in 2011 playing high school football then joined then became a paratrooper that kept lifting through knee pain and forgot the whole keep your feet and knees together deal. I've gotten cortisone injections and platelet-rich plasma injections in both knees for meniscus damage along with that ACL reconstruction + meniscus shave on the right knee.

Anyways, yesterday I went to a VA medical center and got xrays on both knees showing that I already have clear signs of osteoarthritis, particularly in my right patella. Bone spur formation at the top and all. I set up another round of PRP injections in the next month and was told that I would no doubt need a total knee replacement at some point in my hopefully distant future.

My question is do any of you have a reasonably positive experience having extensive joint issues that required medication/surgery yet continued powerlifting? I refuse to resort to switching to swimming and ellipticals exclusively as was recommended. My poverty lifts continue to improve despite the intermittent knee pain.

I have a 3 week peaking template I’m going to use, I’ll be coming off a deload after a high volume block.

1603901072,"**Background and Training**

So this was my 2nd meet and the first in 18 months. I began working with my coach right after completing my first meet, where I did everything myself.  Like everyone else, we were impacted by Covid-19 so there were a few months of training how I could, but we made the most of it.  Overall training style is a DUP based program that is very customized to me.  Being 36 years old, my joints just don't recover like they used to so we have to continuously be flexible depending on what is hurting and why.  My body does well when volumes are high, but as soon as load on the bar goes up, so do all the other issues.  So it's a constant battle of managing fatigue / pain but still progressing.  Overall we have done a really good job and I'm really happy with the progress we were able to make.  My total went from 1242lbs in meet 1 to 1436lbs in this meet.  So just shy of 200lbs in 18months, including Covid.  I can't complain about that.


**The Lifts**

Went 8/9, missing only my first bench, which I am still kicking myself for. Leading into the meet I have been fighting through some pretty bad bicep tendinitis and I was so concerned with how that was going to be I jumped the start command on my first attempt.  The bicep ended up being a complete non-factor and I never even felt it on my lifts.  Missing the first attempt did cause us to take a more conservative 2nd attempt and then I didn't set an all-time PR on attempt 3, only tied my best Gym PR.  So only myself to blame for not hitting a new bench PR.  Moral of the story:  Listen for your commands.

Here is the video of all my attempts. All of my openers were already Meet PRs, so that was a good place to be going into the meet. https://youtu.be/4lCju6RIl20


**Squat**

205KG, make, meet PR: Hit this weight and above several times over the course of the prep, was dealing with an adductor strain leading into the meet so attempt 1 was conservative.  Also I am a big proponent of making sure the first squat goes well, it just builds confidence and momentum for all the other lifts.
220KG, make, All time PR: I had hit 217.5kg for a smooth single in the last training block so I had no doubts this would be there.  They actually misloaded the bar and thankfully I looked at the screen right before walking out.  I saw 225 was on the screen and I asked my coach, is that right?  He ran over to the table and they had made a mistake, so they fixed it on the board and then loaded the correct amount.  PSA... double check your screen showing what is loaded before you start each lift.  I probably still would have been able to hit it, but it would have been a really big jump from my first attempt.  
227.5KG, make, All time PR: This was my real goal for the meet, I really wanted to squat over 500lbs.  I was super hyped after hitting this and there was even some left in the tank.


**Bench**

152.5KG, miss: I was too worried about my bicep and jumped the start command.  The weight flew off my chest though and had no real pain so I knew we would be good in subsequent attempts.  Also I was the last one to go in my flight on bench... that was a first.
157.5KG, make, meet PR: I had never missed a lift before so I was pretty nervous going into this one.  I knew I could move the weight just had to make sure to listen to the commands. The weight moved very well so we went up.
165KG, make, meet PR, tied All time PR: Honestly I had 5kg more left in me but this at least tied the best I had done in the gym and honestly was all I was looking to hit entering the day because I was nervous of how my bicep was going to play out.


**Deadlift**

230KG, make, Meet PR: I had hit all the way up to 247.5kg in training so I had no doubts this was going to move well.  
250KG, make, All time PR: I was pretty fatigued by this point but attempt 1 had flown off the ground and I was confident I could at least hit this.  It felt heavy but still moved smooth and I held form throughout.
260KG, make, All time PR: This was the only ""YOLO""ish attempt we had.  It was final attempt, we had already secured PRs across the lifts and we didn't really know where the upper limit of my DL was.  So after seeing 250 move we felt comfortable that 260 would go.  It was definitely heavy, but it moved better than I expected. 

**Results**
I ended up placing 1st in my class as I was the only submaster lifter in the 100kg class.  I'll have to wait until the official results are posted, but I think I would have won best lifter if I had also paid to enter the open class.  I don't really care either way as I'm just here to improve on my own lifts.


**Final thoughts**
I could not have asked for a better meet.  First time working with a coach and it was such a better experience.  I am really excited to start building again and I think the next goal for me is a 700kg total.  Long term I am looking to be competitive in the Masters 40-44 class, so I have a few years to get over 1600lb total.  Something to shoot for, but I think it is attainable if I focus more on long term and staying healthy over short term results.",powerlifting,"[Meet Report][Flair Update] USPA Unleash the Beast - Fort Worth, Texas (652.5kg @ 96.9 l 402 wilks) 36yo 100kg Submaster"

I am a relatively new lifter, I started in June at 16 years old and 135 pounds. My starting numbers were horrible, but I loved it and kept training 4 days a week with an Olympic weightlifting/powerlifting coach.

I trained using Average to Savage 2.0 Reps to Failure template. I planned on joining the program party but that gosh darn COVID ruined it, so I bought the program and got to work. I ran the program  up to week 10 and my excel file erased itself and then I restarted the program again. Then I mistimed my training with my meet so I ended up running the last 5 weeks twice. I love this style of programming and the spreadsheets are amazing. Best training template I’ve everbought. I am going to do a full write up for the program and my additions for single ply on that subreddit.
 

Meet Day:
 

USAPL requires same day weigh-ins so I got to the venue around 6:50 that morning and got weighed in around  7:40. Weighed in at 108kg with all my clothes on. I needed to be in the 120kg because I was going to set the single-ply record for my state in that class. Happy with this weight.
 

Squats:
Warm ups felt great, but my timing was a little off with getting my suit on for my last warmups. Order of warm ups: Bar-135-225-315-(PUT ON SUIT)405-455-475. This felt great and my lifts were popping.
 

1st attempt-230kg two whites
Felt really easy but one judge called me on depth. The main issue I had was that they had a hiccup adjusting the racks height and I had wrapped my knees 1 person out, by the time I got to lift my legs were getting numb. Regardless hit it and onto the next
 

2nd attempt-245kg(PR)-three whites
Oh man this lift. So the lifter before me wanted his rack moved in for a wide grip, I don’t know how they got us confused but they moved my rack in also. So when they called me bar ready I was ammonia’d up and ready to squat but noticed the rack misplaced. I asked why and they said I wanted it. I was losing feeling in my toes so I just said Ok and got under the bar with the narrowest grip I have ever squatted with and tried to get tight. This lift sucked, but I hit it regardless. Asked to have the rack adjusted for me next rep and they said no problem.
 

3rd attempt 252.5kg (PR) State Record -3 whites!
I asked a former student and great overall person to wrap my knees for my last attempt as I knew he had a reputation for being a tight wrapper. HOLY SHIT. I have never had this tight of a wrap. Got under the barbell, hit depth and blasted it back up. Could’ve got more. STATE SINGLE PLY RECORD
 

Bench
My bench is horrible. Anyway, warmed up and on my last warm up with the shirt 285, my hamstrings cramped. I thought they were going to rip off the bone so I rolled them out and massaged and stretched as much as possible. Then went out to lift.
 

1st attempt 140kg-3 whites
Felt good except the tightness and cramps went to my back now. Easy lift overall though.
 

2nd attmempt 147.5kg fail
Back really cramped up and I misgrooved it and passed on  the third also. At least I am still in the meet!
 

Deadlifts.
Felt like a piece of beat up tofu but I still warmed up and put the suit on early. Put it on around 405 and usually put it on around 475. Warm ups felt fantastic. Bar was flying off the ground.
 

1st attempt 242.5kg 3 whites
Felt good lockout was rough, so I dialed back my second.
 

2nd attempt 252.5kg falil
Yeah. I was dead. I missed at lockout and felt deflated. I have hit this in my garage but that was with bumpers so who knows. Decided to run it back for a third attempt.
 

3rd attempt 252.5kg fail
Gave it my all and fought it for a long time but regardless didn’t achieve it.
 

Overall 635 @ 108. Just shy of 1400lbs total. Still since there is no record in my division I set a new record! I hope someone comes along and beats it! I also got drug tested for the first time and I couldn’t stop laughing when I had to pee in a cup. It was so funny. Thanks for reading and watching the videos.

im curious and trying to get some inputs on carb loading for heavy workouts. I know some people feel they don't need them but I always tend to feel stronger when i have a good amount in me. Anyways, I am wondering how you guys time the load. I have a slower metabolism (borderline mesomorph body type but i don't look like one). I usually carb load the day of but i am wondering if that is too late and maybe i should start night before or morning of instead of at lunch and my preworkout meal.

1603531321,,powerlifting,Lets share favorite powerlifting playlists
1603519976," 

Hi everyone,

I'm relatively new when it comes to posting so apologies if I mess up somewhere.

**Background:**

When I started, I had never competed. I was 21 years old, with an S/B/D of 210/130/280 (KG). Full disclaimer, the 210 was extremely dodgy in depth, the bench was touch and go, and the deadlift was on a deadlift bar, with bumpers, straps, and done while standing about 2-3 inches off the ground. Prior to starting coaching, I had not deadlifted in over a year. I got to this stage by following cookie cutter programs like Smolov, over and over again, and as expected, had started developing tendinopathy.

**1st Contact:**

I was lifting at the gym, following the hepburn method, and got to talking to Kian on a friendly basis. At the time, I was doing 180 kilos for 8 sets of 2, and while I would hit depth, I would fold over a lot. This made sense in retrospect as 180 was my 5 rep max for squats, but when you're stupid you just hammer away without thinking. Kian eventually got to talking about competing, and if I had ever considered it, I said no, I didn't really have time (university), and I was also a broke college kid. Kian was working under this training group called JPS Australia, and offered to help me out. I did a little research, found out that he had a few strong guys training with him, and everyone had good things to say. I took the plunge.

Training:

The first thing Kian did was spend a few weeks really cleaning up my form. I want to stress here that while I was paying a DISCOUNTED rate for online coaching, Kian would often offer to come down to the gym at the same time as me and train me just because that's the sort of bloke he is. He taught me how to perform accessories, how to program them, and how to not look like an ape in the gym. 2-3 months in, my squat, deadlift, and bench form was orders of magnitude better. I had developed tendinopathy prior to coaching with Kian (smolov lol), and Kian helped me rehab that and taught me how to perform prehab. I don't want to go into the specifics of programming too much out of respect for Kian, but it was updated weekly, and involved a good mix of specific movements as well as accessories, with periodization and minute adjustments made even throughout the week based on what I told him after workouts. He also provided a nutrition plan which I followed pretty closely.

Coaching relationship:

Over the year training with Kian, we developed a friendship. I can say that as a coach, he is extremely responsive, respectful, and competent. He was extremely motivational, and I would still be coaching under him today if the circumstances of this year had not occurred. I was meant to compete in the nationals in the Junior categories in Australia, which is obviously cancelled (I qualified in a small competition), and as it is my last year as a junior, I have no interest in competing in the open category at the moment as I am entering my field as a doctor soon.

*Squat Results*:

I had serious hip pain and knee pain going into programming. At the end of our coaching, I was unpeaked, trained for about 4 weeks, and hit 190 kilos for 6 repetitions on the squat. It felt easy, light, and I am absent of any nagging pain. This was done while not peaked.

*Bench Results*:

Bench shot up, but the first few months were spent rehabbing my shoulder. Did not try to hit a PR, but went from a 10 repetition max of 100 kilos to a 10 repetition maximum of 120 kilos.

*Deadlift results*:

I had not deadlifted in over a year, and honestly, had never actually performed a deadlift with good form ever. Kian taught me from scratch, and I went on to hit a 240 kilogram deadlift for 6 repetitions.

**Final thoughts**

I made a lot of progress with Kian, and my only real regret is that I was unable to go to the Junior Nats with him. All my repetition PRs were hit after training with him, with me just trying to gauge where I was. Overall, highly recommend him, apologies for not having videos of my lifts up, I'm not sure how to do that.

1603423055,"**Background and Training**

* So this was my 5th meet and the first in over a year. I did not really want to take a full year off of competing but for a bunch of circumstances out of my control, I was kind of forced to. I was registered to do USAPL Collegiate Nationals but COVID-19 understandably threw a wrench in that, when that fell through (I'm aware it is still happening but I personally can't make the time to go now) I signed up for this meet that was supposed to happen 1 week after, foolishly hoping local meets would still happen back in April. As we all know that was not the case, gym closures made things harder but this is where the fun begins actually.
* I went about 6 total days with no barbell lifting. I had an old Rogue 2.0 Crossfit bar laying around and a friend of mine was gracious enough to let me borrow 2 of his plates. So for about 1 week I had 135lbs to work with. I completely re-did the setup of my bedroom to make room for it and was able to find a pair of cheap squat stands on eBay rated for 550lbs that ended up working pretty good for both squatting and benching. To make a long and arduous story short, I broke the bank for Eleiko bumpers (only thing in stock), a Rep Fitness bench, a pair of Vulcan Calibrated plates, and scrounged up as many old plates I could find from my old high school gym. 
* I did, in my own estimation, around 60% of my prep for this meet in my bedroom. It was.. not optimal but it allowed me to continue progressing. I did about 20-25% of prep on my outdoor porch as if I did a deadlift in my room I would create an abyss with 245lbs and it was a little safer to squat. Finally, I did about 20% of my prep in a home shed gym 2 athletes I am fortunate enough to coach allowed for. Again, nothing was optimal but I got through May-October with it!

**Meet Prep**

* So I have programmed for myself since the advent of my PL career. I would say how I train now is vastly different from how I trained when I first started. By trial and error I've found some really cool things that work for me individually. Things such as higher rep, high frequency benching at moderate intensities, squatting with higher rep ranges very close to a test/meet, and very low volume, high intensity deadlifts really brought all 3 lifts up for me. I think from the beginning of post-lockdown to now I put 27lbs on my squat, 20lbs on my bench press, and 20lbs on my deadlift.
* If y'all go back and look at some of my training posts, you can see my set-up is not really the safest. My safeties many times were trash cans and I would be lifting in close quarters others and later down the line I would fight the cold of the northeast. However, this arguably helped more than it hindered me for 2 main reasons. The first was I was way more likely to undershoot my top sets for the day than overshoot (sort of) by virtue of catastrophe if I overshot. However, in the same vein, it also gave me a sense of fearlessness I had to at least pretend was there because the state you have to put yourself in when taking a heavy weight with no spotters that can injure you if you miss on top of destroy your set-up/cause immense damage is a very unique state of mind lol. Nonetheless, I would not trade it for the world.
* This was the heaviest I've been a week out from a meet but I feel comfortable enough with cutting water now that I want to push it even heavier next time because this made a huge difference!

**The Lifts**

* Went 8/9, missing only my second deadlift which I am still kicking myself in the head for. Stupid technical error that caused the 3rd to be way harder than it should have been but other than that, I think everything else went as good as it possibly could.
* [https://www.instagram.com/p/CGfitj3lwBi/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGfitj3lwBi/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) Here is the link to the heaviest lifts of the day.

**Squat**

* 187.5KG, make, meet PR: Hit this weight and above several times over the course of the prep, was slightly aggressive but felt easier than anticipated.
* 197.5KG, make, meet PR: Pretty confident in this as I had doubled 5lbs under this in training. Sunk it ATG which made it harder but for the first time in a meet I went aggressive on squat and I am glad I did.
* 205KG, make, meet and all time PR: I really thought this number was possible about 9 days out and I am glad things lined up with my taper to where I think I even had 2.5kg left in the tank comfortably. This was euphoric.
* **Bench**
* 112.5KG, make: Always ere on the conservative side for bench, easy opener. Dropped it down 2.5kg from what I initially had a week out because bench felt so, so horrible until about 3 days out. This is a theme with every meet I have done.
* 117.5KG, make: Moved insanely good so went with my high end number.
* 122.5KG, make, meet PR: Honestly might have had 2.5kg-5kg more left in me but this was a meet PR and my first meet 3rd attempt bench was 97.5kg lol @ 10.5 rpe, so I am not too cranky when benches move good on the third. Cool stat to share at the end of this.

**Deadlift**

* 222.5KG, make, meet PR: Felt like I was going to vomit up until my last warm up, this moved easy so I jumped to my planned second.
* 235KG, miss: A couple reasons why I think I missed this. I was way too far over the bar and not connected enough to have a smooth transition from the floor, to knee, to lockout. Also, and this is a mistake totally on me, this was the first time in MONTHS that I pulled a competition deadlift after competition squats. I don't like the ""I was tired"" excuse because you have to be in piss-poor shape to get tired from 9 lifts plus warmups BUT I do think having no data of what my pull was like with pre-fatigue from comp squatting hindered me and caused me to overestimate my top end strength. Hindsight is 2020.
* 235KG, make, meet PR: The first time I have ever made a lift I missed immediately prior, in a meet or training, so this meant a lot because it secured the total I had coming into the day. Dreams and Nightmares by Meek Mill..... This was a lot harder than it should have been but this is my first real grinder pull in a meet. There aren't many conventional pullers in the lower weight classes so I had to put on for those who do..
* **Results**
* I ended up placing 1st overall based on IPF GL points. I was actually handling 2 athletes I coach in the session after this one and when they announced the male overall best lifter I was still there so I was able to be recognized hahah, not that I think it means much but this is the first time I have ever won something like that so it was cool.
* I love competing so much.
* **Final thoughts**
* After browsing a bit, it seems that as of now, for my class and weight class, this is #9 based on total. Subject to change for sure but it gave me some very glaring data moving forward. Of the top 10, 7/10 bench over 300lbs. Of the 3/10 who do not, I have the lowest of the 3 @ 122.5kg/270lbs. I do not have the mobility most of the light weights have in order to do an exorcist arch with a wide grip so I have to kinda do things the old fashioned way so to speak. Need to gain more upper body mass and will be working on taking my grip out slightly. I cannot wait to get back to competition again but I really feel this meet taught me that longer times spent training yields the most amount of progress PLUS I really do think I have just scratched the surface of my potential. Next meet will most likely be in the spring and hopefully by then I can bring a respectable bench to the platform.

OHP: 165x4 RPE 8.5
Body weight: 185

Pros: I loved the secondary volume. I split up lifts where on bench days I’d do my 5x10 @ 70% OHP as the third movement (Should be second but I will touch on this later). Each week I would do the 5x10 @ 70%. The first two weeks I noticed on set 5 I would stall out on rep 8 or 9. I would wait ten seconds and crank out the remaining reps. I believe this was more of a mental hurdle than physical. Another pro would be workout time. Including warming up, I would be out in an hour and 15 minutes. I did appreciate this.

Cons: not enough back volume. The recommended back volume were a 5x10 of pull-ups twice a week. With all the pressing (I also added an optional hypertrophy day for upper body) I believe that there should have been more back work by 2 or threefold. The program is also redundant and can feel boring doing the same workout over and over. I didn’t feel this way until the last two weeks so perhaps this is just me. 

Adjustments: I added additional hypertrophy backwork. I also did this between movement one and two of upper body days to give those muscles a break. I either added pendley rows or weighted pull-ups for a 4x6 at RPE 7 then a 2x8 at RPE 5 and super-setted with some type of ab movement. The first three weeks I did not do this but for month 2 and 3 I did and felt a noticeable improvement. I did not add any additional volume for lower body days as I play soccer 1-3 times a week and did not want to overdo anything. Lastly, for the additional hypertrophy days I would focus on arms since those were the days my wife would come with me...I regret nothing. 

Diet: I made sure to hit about 180g of protein, drink a gallon a day, and plenty of veggies. I know results would be better if I were more focused but I enjoy food and trying new restaurants.

Another note: A big factor I found was getting new music for each month. When the music would stall I began to stall. 

Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed the program. I know my numbers aren’t the best and I would consider myself an intermediate in the loosest of terms but this was a great program to build a solid base. Moving forward, I began nSuns again today after giving myself a week off. Any critiques would be appreciated on either program.

1602354223,"Hi,

I have been trying to do some research on the pros and cons of narrow vs wide squats both on Reddit and with various studies. As with many things these days all I have found so many conflicting studies. I used to hate squats but love deadlifts and so I would avoid them at all costs. This produced a drastic difference between my squat and deadlift to where I have been deadlifting twice my squat. I have since started squatting really narrow and I find I can go a lot deeper and I really enjoy them. Before I felt my squat was more of a back exercise then anything because I was leaning over so much. The really narrow squat allows me to have an upright position even when going ATG. My question is will I have any muscle imbalances with narrow squat because it seems most people do wide squats? Should I try to work on my flexibility to do wide squats or just continue with the narrow? What is causing this difference between the two?",powerlifting,Narrow vs Wide Stance Squat

Similarities:

-Missed reps in last 2 workouts but still completed the total amount of reps with extra sets
-I had tight pecs both times

Differences
-With the original version I had elbow pain in 3rd week, I did not have that with my version. 
-I was eating a lot (3500-4000kcal) when I did the original version, while doing my version I ate whenever I was hungry (less calories and protein as I don't have a big appetite)
-Less geometric strength increase (7.7% with original, 7.1% with the modified) but keep in mind that weight increments were also proportional as the amount of kilos added each week did not change with the starting 1 Rep Max

Conclusion:

1601993870,"TL:DR - After 4 weeks since gym opened I managed to get to a 90kg bench touch n go, ran smolov for 3 weeks and got 100kg for 2ct pause.

Background

22 years old uni student, 5'10"", bodyweight was around 88-90kg (194-198lbs). Started basic bodybuilding around 2 years ago and then switched to powerlifting roughly 1 year ago. Throughout the year bench has always been my weakest in terms of strength and form, which is odd considering my strict press is 80kg (176lbs). During that year I started out with a basic 5x5 and then swapped over to nSuns 5/3/1 and made amazing gains on my dead and squat.

My best gym lifts are :

High bar squat 160kg (353lbs)

Bench 100kg (220lbs) this was touch n go, bum off the bench

Sumo deadlift 185kg

Training

4 weeks after gyms had opened I managed to get back some decent strength on all my lifts but I knew my bench was awful, 90kg touch n go felt like absolute hell and so I wanted to sort it out now because I wanna be able to bench confidently in the long run!

So I decided to pause all my reps and really focus on correcting my leg drive and upper back stabilisation, this worked amazingly for me as every week felt easier and easier (Although week 3 day 3 really kicked my arse). I also found out that my gym partner gives amazing hand offs which really helped when I decided to max out.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jxSlYB8?fbclid=IwAR0FzvmicwvAtlTF5vDgmgaoXTHlwnNG5KI002PhC3mZCMp9i1Hp0ENnGAw) is a video of week 4 day 4, which was 10 sets of 3 @ 85kg (188lbs)

For accessories I did a lot of lateral pulldowns, hammer curls, face pulls and rows, these were done on the lighter bench days 1 and 2 of each week. On the heavier days I focused on leg accessories, but I did not squat or deadlift much, maybe once or twice during this routine but that was mainly due to an issue with my tailbone.

For stretching I mainly focused on my lower back and legs, again due to my tailbone issue but I also did lots of shoulder dislocations before and after working out.

For warm ups it consisted of mainly face pulls and close grip lat pulldowns.

Diet

I have used myfitnesspal for a long time so eyeballing food has kind of come naturally to me, but for this program I knew calories were needed. I stuck to hitting a goal of 150g MINIMUM protein everyday, 4g of omega 3 from tinned sardines (They slap with pesto mayo) and literally anything else whilst keeping it about 70/30 healthy food to junk food. I probably averaged out to 2500-3000 calories daily.

I also make my own preworkout as it is way cheaper, here is a list of ingredients!

300-400mg caffeine (only used this on day 3 and day 4 of each week)

4g L-Citrulline

1g Taurine

20-30g Dextrose

2g Vitamin C tablets (Mainly for flavour but also a bit of vitamin C does not hurt)

Maxing out

I gave myself a week off benching and did some light squats, deads and bodybuilding style workouts. I realistically never planned to max out as I wanted to run another cycle, I did not feel confident at all to try and PR but my friend basically pushed me to do it.

Here is how I maxed out

Empty bar 20kg (44lbs) 2 x 8 This honestly felt awful, felt stiff af

40kg (88lbs) 2 x 5 Again did not feel too great, mainly just stiff

60kg (132lbs) 1 x 3 Surprisingly felt much better

70kg (154lbs) 1 x 1 This was the moment where my confidence came back, 70kg is not heavy in general for me but it felt like benching 40kg so I knew today was the big day!

80kg (176lbs) 1 x 1 Again felt like nothing

90kg (198lbs) 1 x 1 This moved ok but unracking the weight my right shoulder came loose and so I lost a lot of upper back tightness

95kg (209lbs) 1 x 1 The difference in getting a hand off by my friend made this lift that much easier than the previous one, I honestly never realised how much a hand off can change a lift!

100kg (220lbs) 1 x 1 Again the hand off really helped keep me tight, lowered the bar slowly and let it sit on top of me for 2 seconds and the bar came up slowly, I did struggle to lockout but we got it!

Final Conclusion

Smolov Jr is an amazing program, not only did I hit a big PR but I also changed my bench form completely! I had no injuries during this program and I actually quite enjoyed running it, so I will be running it again for another cycle. Apologies for not having a video of my PR, unfortunately I don't know how to record video whilst listening to music on iPhone!",powerlifting,[Program Review] Smolov JR for bench

This is going to be long, in part because I like to go back and read these to reflect on what I learned every meet, and because when I was a noob I needed more experienced lifters to tell me literally everything that could possibly happen on meet day so I could mentally prepare myself. I'm also going to be pretty transparent about the things I had going on in my non-lifting life leading into this meet, because October is ADHD Awareness Month, and because the longer I've been in the sport, the more I understand how real life shows up on the platform, and it's important to remain cognizant of what you're overcoming, on and off the platform.  Skip about halfway down for the actual lifting.  Videos of all 9 attempts are split between IG and imgur links, included below. 

**BACKGROUND**

This was meet number six for me, my third in wraps and my second in the 181 class. Since my last meet in November 2019, I have been working with Lones Green (calloused hands), training conjugate. He has been great to work with, willing to make adjustments where my body demands it (for instance, dealing with elbow tendinitis) and willing to push me where I need it. He's been calling for this total (a little higher tbh) since I registered for a meet in May 2020, which obviously didn't happen. His style is based in conjugate, with traditional max effort and dynamic effort days, with a lot of training volume. Once I got acclimated to the volume, I loved it.  I get a wide range of accessories to address weak points and build up my strong points, and it's generally just a fun way to lift.  It's built incredible work capacity which kept me comparatively fresh by the time it was time to deadlift and built the ability to both rep out big weight and smoke new PR singles pretty regularly. I've also stayed healthy, and I plan to continue with this style as long as Lones wants to keep coaching and my body holds up.

Leading into this meet, I had a lot of personal life things going on. Some were very positive, but some were fairly traumatic, and either way, it's a big emotional/mental/spiritual demand while also prepping for a meet. I moved in with my boyfriend at the end of August, which has been great!  He has been a champ all the way through, and is really the MVP of this story.  But telling my family went really, really poorly, and feeling that kind of rejection from the most important people in my life was one of the most painful things I've ever felt. Things have settled there, but it was really rough for a while. I also don't really recommend moving at six weeks out during the busiest work week of the entire year, but sometimes it be like that. 

The other thing was getting assessed, diagnosed, and then trying a medication for ADHD. I'm a 31 (relatively) accomplished attorney, and had no idea until quarantine that the constant feeling of ""I'm lazy and why can't I cope like everyone else"" wasn't normal.  While it's a relief to know what the problem is, and to know that there are options to address my deficits, it's also crushing to find out that I have struggled against my own brain chemistry for 31 years and had no idea, and just spent that time beating myself up instead. There is an intense grieving process that goes with the diagnosis.  I don't want to be this way, but here we are, and now it's time to fight, this time with all the correct information.  I'm about five weeks into my first shot at medication, and it has not gone super well, but I know I have other options and I'm hopeful those work a little better for me. Shoutout to r/adhd for being an amazing resource; if you're struggling too, or think this is something you may be coping with, that's the most supportive subreddit I've ever seen. I know that my real name is very easily connected with this account, and I don't care. I'm not ashamed I've been medicated for depression for 6 years, so I am not going to be ashamed of the ADHD either.  I'm not the only attorney in the world with ADHD, and I won't hide if it helps someone else get help.

Finally, ten days out from competing, two of the people that I've been closest to since I moved to this area completely iced me out. I don't want to doxx them and I'm not going to get into the dramatic details or try to make them look like the devil, but this sucked. A lot. I didn't want to let it shake me up, but these two are also competitors, and to do this to someone you purportedly care about right before competition is not an accident. I don't wish them ill and I know I'll be better in the long term without that kind of toxicity in my life, but wow, not having them cheering for me this time--out of nowhere--shook me up. A lot. It showed up on the platform. I wish I were strong enough to say it didn't, but I'll own my mental weakness here. However, this experience really highlighted all the people who are absolutely in my corner, and that has been a gift.

okay enough of Pretzel's diary, let's lift.

**SQUAT** (1/3)

lol. Just lol. This was an all systems failure that I have never experienced on the platform and hope to never experience again. Guy wrapping me was outstanding and my bf was great at keeping me calm, but shew lawd 1/10 do not recommend.

1st attempt: 390 [all i can say is wtf](https://imgur.com/a/QCnoKD8).  This is easy weight for me, and even though I had been training with an up call for weeks, I jumped the call, realized I jumped it, and did this bizarre 1.5 squat. I mean, WTF? It was light, so I jumped to 410 and tried to shake it off.

2nd attempt: 410 [Narrator: She did not shake it off.](https://imgur.com/a/okNi3WX)  At this point I was DISTRAUGHT. I hadn't ever misssed a freaking opener, let alone stared bombing out in the face. These guys [were on the way.](https://imgur.com/a/2h4mWhY)

1601782911,"If anyone has good scientific articles I’d love to see them, but I was hoping for anecdotes from those of you who are in the top percentiles of strength. As you trained and increased your deadlift squat and bench what benefits did you notice outside those lifts? Do you think there is a point of diminishing returns for health or athletic performance, and where do you think that was for you? I am hoping this info could help push non specialized powerlifting athletes to set strength standards for themselves.",powerlifting,Benefits of increasing your Max vs Volume?
1601781485,"**Description and Context:** This program is all about the bench. There is no deadlifting at all and very minimal squatting, really only enough squatting to maintain your current numbers. I’ve been going to the gym for about two years, although really only about 13 months due to getting severely sick twice in that time period and having to take three months off twice to recover.  I plan to compete in bench only eventually, once I put on some more mass, and I do not really care that much for squatting or deadlifting. Yes I still train legs. I was previously half way through Sheiko Advanced Load and then Covid-19 came and closed the gyms down. So I ended up taking a two month break with zero training and zero tracking calories of any sort before starting this program.

**Results:** Previous best was 102.5kg @ 72.5kg/225.5lbs @ 159.5lbs. At the end of the program I benched 122kg@ 81kg/268.4lbs @ 178.2lbs. A 19.5kg/42.9lbs PB.

**Alterations:** I changed the program to fit my needs a bit better. Sheiko has you bench – squat – bench, I ran the bench then squat, combined the two benches and did the second bench in reverse. So pyramiding up from 50% and finishing at 50%. I think this is pretty normal and a lot of people do this.

All the pin presses I changed to feet up benching as I need more time under tension and need to grow. The last two of my sets of either comp bench or feet up bench depending on the day I did with a 10 second pause (usually these were 50% or 60% due to doing the second bench cycle in reverse). I also did 2 or 3 count pauses on basically all benching.

I also changed the rep ranges for the assistance work. Kept the same amount of sets but upped the reps to 15 as I need the extra hypotrophy. I also added assistance work depending on how I was feeling. Usually added one or two exercises, 3 sets of 15 for both. You will have to compare the spreadsheet to the original to find the changes, I can’t recall where I might’ve changed the spreadsheet sorry.

I also changed the good mornings to a back and a hamstring exercise instead. If you are competing in all three lifts I would suggest running the good mornings, but I am only concerned about the bench. I am sure I changed more of the assistance work to suit myself but again you will have to compare with the original source sorry.

**Discussion:**

· **Structure:** This program is 4 times a week and you bench every day. On average not including the comp cycle it work’s out to be about 3.17 sets of 12 @ average intensity of 75% intensity each day. Some days are more, some less. These are broken up into smaller sets which are similar to other Sheiko programs. I find this to be very good at perfecting technique. A standard day is bench, followed by 2-5 types of assistance work.

· **Volume/Frequency/Loading/Intensity:** The program is all about volume and low weights. It does a very good job of perfecting your technique, however if you are not actively thinking and focusing on technique and just going through the motions, it might not work so well. Each session took me about an hour. I found the volume to really not be that much at all. I would have liked more volume, and I plan on adding 20% more benching on the next run through. Even with the extra assistance work I added I felt like I could still of done more bench volume and still recovered. It is about 600 bench reps in each 4 week prep block. 

**·** **Periodisation/Progression:**

Sheiko manipulates volume rather then intensity. The two prep cycles usually followed a high volume week followed by a lower volume week, with volume dropping for the peaking cycle. The average weekly intensity remains within 71.45% -75.11%. I found the program to be very effective at managing intensity and volume.

· **Specificity:** 

It is a very specific program for the bench. The majority of the assistance work is designed around improving the bench, with only minimal assistance work to maintain the squat.

· **Auto-regulation/fatigue management:** 

Larger weekly loads are followed by smaller weekly loads and this did a good job of fatigue management. Throughout the program I never felt beat or worn out. There is a mini deload in the comp cycle before a skills test, and a two week period where volume is reduced before your comp/max. I’ve heard people dislike the longer taper (?) before you test, but I found it to be optimal for me. I’ll talk a bit more about this at the bottom.\*

· **Customisation:** Sheiko programs imo are meant to be customised to the individual. Sheiko himself says this. I changed quite a few things overall but kept the general structure the same. If you haven’t run a Sheiko program before, then run the program as is first and then add major changes (in terms of overall bench volume). However, in saying this I think even on your first run through you can add more assistance work, you just need to be smart and honest with yourself about whether you are recovering enough.

However, if you are going to add bench volume, keep the same average intensity. It’s designed that way for a reason. I believe they did a study and they found 75% is the best average intensity for strength building. Pavel Tsatsouline talks about this in the Joe Rogan podcast, and I believe a actual scientific study was done.

**Pros:** By far this has been my favourite program to run. I really enjoyed the overall volume and benching more often. I was glad to be able to actually finish a 14 week Sheiko cycle without getting sick like the previous two times, or without Covid-19 closing down the gyms. I enjoyed being able to really focus on technique and getting it nailed down. I made some major technique changes at the start in regards to how I set up and using a Japanese grip and the program allowed me to focus on this.

**Cons:** The only thing I did not like was the original assistance work rep ranges, however I changed this at the start. In the original program sometimes you might only do an exercise such as barbell lunges once in the whole program, and then you never see it again. Again this is something that I changed prior. Apart from that but I really don’t have any cons to say at all.

I was expecting more overall volume though, so I would say for me the volume was a bit low. Common thing I hear with Sheiko programs is the lack of 90% work. I somewhat agree. On my next run through I think I will maybe add about 4 singles/doubles of 90% work throughout the program but that’s about it, still whilst maintaining the average intensity though.

**Recommendations:** I wouldn’t run this program with any other program such as a squat program. I would recommended this program to anyone who wants to increase their bench, as long as your okay with just maintaining your squat.

I’m not sure whether this is true but I feel like if you are a bigger lifter 100kg + you might not be able to recover from the volume. I think larger people generally can’t handle as much volume as smaller lifters? Again I am not sure if this the actual case or not so don’t be too harsh on my comment there. Also, if you have shoulder issues the bench volume might be an issue so I would not recommend if you do have shoulder issues.

Speaking of shoulders there is no direct shoulder work at all. I found that with the overall bench volume you did not need direct shoulder work, and it would have affected recovery if I added shoulder work, so I would not recommend adding shoulders as extra work. I would run this program with your actual max as well. If you find that the weights are too easy as I did initially, do all the bench work with longer pauses. 

**Conclusion:** \*Wasn’t sure where to put this so I’ll just chuck it here. I’ve seen some people comment on this sub about their skills test not going well. On my skills test I grinded out a 100% single at a RPE of 15, which moved slower than the last time I benched that much. I had some doubt about the effectiveness of the program after the skills test. However this was just the accumulated fatigue talking as after the two week taper I went on to bench a 19.5kg PB.

All in all I had a great time running this program. I’ve always enjoyed the Sheiko programs. I enjoy the smaller sets and being able to focus on technique. I plan on running this program in the future with an extra 20% bench volume. I would recommend this to everyone except people who have shoulder issues, and maybe bigger people due to potentially not being able to recover from the volume.

I’ve tried my best to be as thorough, detailed and clear written as possible. If you have any questions or need me to clarify anything please let me know. Finally, if you wish to use the spreadsheet, you need to unhide the columns, add in your max in column F in each tab, and in column D in the Volume Intensity % Tab change the formula to \[D3/B3/”insert your max here”\]. Note, the spreadsheet is my modified version of the original.

1601426810,"Constant plateaus when benching

I am starting to think my genetics are very bad in terms of lifting. I’ve been lifting for 1.5 years and have a 255lb squat, 175lb bench, 315lb deadlift. All my friends are progressing five pounds a week on their bench. My bench has progressed 5 lbs in 4 months. It does not make sense. My squats and deadlifts are going up fine.

I fixed my volume. I get 8 hours of sleep with 1.5-2 hours of deep sleep at night. I get 3000 calories a day with 180-200ish grams of protein a day at a weight of 165lbs 5’11 around 15% body fat. I should be getting stronger quicker. 

My form is not bad. I arch my back slightly, drive my feet into the ground, and have a good upward arc, and retract my scapula.

This may also be the reason I’m such a slow sprinter. I am starting to think I have like no fast twitch muscle fiber in my body. All my friends, some of which who don’t even track their diets or anything are all getting way stronger and they are not on any peds.

Could my 6’5 wingspan be slowing down my bench progress or is it my muscle fiber type in my chest. Do I need to add more volume/ or higher rep sets? I’m at a loss.

I’m Indian in case anyone else from my ethnic group has this problem. Or anyone with a long ass wing span benching. Pls help I’m lost.",powerlifting,Struggling with bench

1601416481,"Prep: For this meet I trained with the TSA 9 Week Intermediate program. It was my second time running it and for the most part it went well. The program keeps all lifting pretty light even during the final weeks of the peak so 3 weeks out I adjusted and allowed myself 2 heavy singles for SBD to give myself a good gauge of what my openers and second attempts would be so I could easily call third attempts. This was my third meet after nearly three years of strength training. Overall, I felt like prep went well and I was going into the meet feeling strong.

Meet: Unfortunately the night before the meet I had trouble falling asleep, but I ended up coming away with about 6.5 hours of sleep. Squat warmups moved well and felt strong going into my opener at 140 kg. It felt exactly like it should have and went to 147.5 kg for my second. It took some effort but it still moved, so my handler called 155 kg for a third, but being too cocky, I overrode and went for 157.5 for a third which I was confident I could hit, but I ended up missing it. Bench warm ups went well too and I opened with 110 kg, which flew so we went to 117.5 kg. It was slower and my right arm lagged a little, but we were both confident I had 125 kg which I did. Deadlift warmups felt off, maybe it was pulling on a deadlift bar which I'm not used to. Opened at 182.5 kg and it went smoothly. Jumped to 192.5 which felt great as well, but needed a bit more effort. We were torn between 200 kg and 202.5, but played it safe and finished with 200 kg for a total of 472.5 kg at 72.9 kg.

If you don't want to read the paragraph it went:

* Squat 1: 140/308
* Squat 2: 147.5/325

1601255261,"This was my second meet, but my first as a 93kg. I ran Jonnie Candito's 6 week program, but was unsure of not doing singles. The testing point was Week 5, when I did 530x4, 305 paused for 4, and 550x4. So I knew this was the strongest I've been with not being able to accurately gauge what singles would feel like, but a friend of mine who also powerlifts gave me a array of attempts to take giving what I felt like. But I had severely deprived myself from food for the majority of the week, and had 4.5 hours of sleep Friday night. I usually have trouble sleeping, but the stress of not making weight only made it worse. I ate a good portion of snacks and Pedialite, Gatorade, and water during the meet but cramped up quite a few times.

Figured the easiest thing to do, is show all of my attempts [here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFpSOy8gNFB/)

Squat 

1. 237.5kg/523.6lbs
2. 245.1kg/540.1lbs
3. 255kg/562.1lbs 

Had 2 white lights and a red for depth on the first two attempts, but I got all whites on the 255 attempt. It was great to have a 50kg comp PR, and a 17lb all time PR. In my first meet, I squatted 205kg as a 83kger.

Bench

1. 140kg/308.6lbs
2. 145kg/319.6lbs
3. 147.5kg/325.1lbs

My bench warmups felt noticeably more challenging than they typically would, but it was also due to the bench rack I was warming up on being too high. I also starting cramping up in my back, and a slight cramp in my forearm. But total on bench, 17.5kg meet PR, and tied my touch and go PR with my third attempt.

Deadlift

1. 250kg/551.1lbs
2. 260kg/573.2lbs
3. 265kg/584.2lbs

Deadlift warmups felt fine like mechanically/technically but 495 and 525 were a tad too slow, and on 525 I got severe cramps in both of my calves.  I had just ran out of gas. Deadlift PRs were 45kg in comp, and a 19lb all time PR.

Total: 

666.75kg/1471.6lbs \[419 Wilks\]

112.5kg/248lb Comp PR 

Saying going 9/9, instead of 4/9 like my first powerlifting meet, and being on cloud 9 right now would be a understatement. I was a tad bit anxious not doing singles during training but Candito's program is no joke. Glad I executed well, but its time to build. Next thing I want to focus on is by next September/October I want to have 165kg/363lbs as a third attempt. It might be time to really program the Slingshot. Also, it was extremely awesome to see a elite lifter in Heather Connor compete. It was a great weekend in general.

So for a while now I’ve been getting dizzy doing high arch bench but especially when I try to arch with my upper back(thereby dragging my upperback up with my leg drive)

I just realized that when I drag my body up my shirt gets really tight around the neck. I also don’t wanna bench shirtless for a number of reasons but do you think it would benefit me to bench in tank tops? I’m not 100% sure if the suffocation is due to the shirt or if its natural but my hemoglobin levels are low to begin with and I don’t think my shirt is helping. 

I can’t experiment right now to see if its the shirt or not but I want to have this problem solved by next session. Should I go ahead and cut up some shirts into tanks or Is there another solution?

If you’ve experienced something similar please help me out. I know its natural to get a littleheaded on arched benches but when I feel like I’m starting to pass out I feel like its too much at that point...",powerlifting,My T-Shirt Chokes me when I bench with Upper Back Arch

1600530819,"Hi all,

3 years ago I started getting in shape again through my girlfriend bringing me to a CrossFit class. I’ve since gotten to know powerlifting and strongman as a sport and I’ve switched over my training to those sports since they suited me a bit better.

I’ve been following other people’s programs with good succes so far, but lately I wanted to try my hand at programming my own stuff.
I’ve got a m’n idea on how progressive overload works, but I would really like to get a more educated view on strength training in general.

Are there any good sources out there where one could learn good coaching/training plan development? The goal is not to coach people at the moment (might follow later if I’m feeling confident enough) but to apply correct training principles to my own training and to continue my progress.

It’s an unusual question here I guess, but I feel that people online just repeat what they hear from others without questioning why some things work and others don’t. I’d like to learn to understand these concepts better through this.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",powerlifting,How to learn training principles/coaching?

I've been back to heavy training for the last three months. I competed off and on from 2009 to 2014. 

My best numbers were at the age of 24: 

238 lbs 

squat 775 wraps

bench 450

deadlift 655

Now I'm 30 y/o weighing roughly 245

Unfortunately, some of life's events took over and while I always lifted consistently, I didn't train above 80/85% for some time. Now, I am getting back into it and have a plan from my original coach that trained me from 2008 to roughly 2010/2011. I am hitting all three lifts 3x a week when I feel like I used to only do twice, then once on my own from 2012-2014 I would hit everything once and would never squat heavy and pull heavy in the same week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am doing all three heavy in the week as well as a 65-70% day and a 50% day. My body has never felt so wrecked in my life. I know I probably need to stretch more and that will help and i have been. 

I am wondering, what frequency you guys prefer to hit the lifts with during the week and what percentages and the rationale behind your approach. 

&amp;#x200B;

good news, my strength is coming back quite a bit. I am finishing my first 4-week training block and am about to start a new one that will incorporate bands. IF there's anything else you guys want to know, let me know.

Hi everyone.

I'm going to start training judo three times a week. I want to fit one day of strength training in there somewhere. Judo tends to be quite excruciating on my body and therefore I really don't want to fit in more than a day a week even if it were possible to fit it in my weekly schedule.

I don't have any specific competitive lifting or adonis physique goals, I just want to steadily grow stronger, even if progress is slower than it would be on 2x or 3x a week. I'm thinking of practising the big three (squats, bench press, and deadlifts) on my gym day.

I would appreciate if anyone knows of any program that addresses such constraints, or if you have any advice on how to slowly keep progressing on such a routine.

1600065164,"I'm hesitant to post this, as come on, how interesting is an old lady benching 105 lbs lol. However, as someone who knew not a single person that lifted (better yet powerlifted) when I began training 11 months ago, and learned everything from how to DL less than 135 lbs to bring rice krispie treats to the meet online, I'm compelled to pay it forward. And possibly give someone in my shoes a year ago the push to sign tf up for a meet.


**Background**


After spending my entire adult life as a sad, lazy and obese stoner whose only fitness experience was 7th grade volleyball, I lost the weight for vanity reasons (70 lbs in 7 months). After about 50 lbs lost (summer 2019), I sat in a Planet Fitness parking lot 3 times before I got the guts to walk in just to get a membership (gyms be scary). The only thing I knew how to do was press start on the treadmill lol. After a few weeks of cardio machines and watching women that at the time I thought were so bad ass (the first time I saw a ""heavy"" hip thrust was when I realized there was more to the iron than jacked dudes mirin), I went to the gym at midnight and figured out how to use all the weight machines in solitude. Starting slowly subbing in machines for DBs a few weeks later while getting over my fear of looking like an idiot watching form vids on youtube. From the moment I did my first bicep curl with a DB (ofc that my first free weight lol), my entire shitty outlook on my weight and fitness changed. I hated cardio, why tf was I trying to run when I can just come to the gym and *lift weights.* Holding weight felt bad ass, and felt way better than working out to be skinny.


While down a late night reddit rabbithole, I learned what powerlifting was, about the supportive community, and that competition was mostly against yourself. I had never done any compounds, and never even gone anywhere near the PF smith machine, but it called to me. After a week of researching as much as someone who didn't know basic gym terminology can do, on September 28, 2019 I joined a gym with real equipment and started GZCLP. I threw myself into that shit, absorbing everything I could online and training 6 days/week (ez when your DL and squat are sub 100 lbs lol). I was incredibly fortunate to receive a random discord invite from someone on r/fitness within a few weeks that had some fairly knowledgeable people that gave me form advice and pointed me to more optimal resources. Training was fun, every single time, and gave me a purpose I had never had before. Quarantine hit, and by then I had made one friend that lifted and THEY HAD A GARAGE GYM. 2 12 week cycles into GZCLP in, I couldn't keep adding 5 lbs/week, and I knew it was in part due to form. I wasn't capable of teaching myself anymore. After reading every post here on how to evaluate a potential coach, I took the plunge 3.5 months ago and hired a well vetted local guy and he recommended this meet.


1RMs were last tested in May, 225 lb/105 lb/275 lb. No question that the squat and bench would not pass judges muster.


**Training**


2 12 week cycles of GZCLP with 2 T2s and 3 T3s every day, then programming from coach last 3.5 months. Second week with coach, I had a terrible flare up of long time sciatica which lasted the remainder of training. The pain prevented me from wearing a belt and DLing. I probably would have spiraled if I had to try to work through that on my own, but he made a physio recommendation and kept me training and pretty calm. Trained 4 days/week, squats twice (pin because the pain was pretty bad deep in the hole, and tempo, both no belt), bench or variation 4 days, and shit tons of heavy as I could manage RDLs. No DLs until about a month out, and that was mostly just testing very light singles to see how I was healing. While recovery was going well as far as my ADLs, it was slow for lifting...and I even tweaked my back further 2 weeks before the meet warming up at 185 lbs. Coach kept me focused and positive.


As to be expected, there was some MAJOR form tweaking when I first hired coach. I wasn't even consistently hitting depth and had no idea 🙈. Within a month, my lifts already looked exponentially cleaner. While I definitely did get stronger, I think the form improvements are the more appreciable benefit.


My peak programming was only 3 weeks, which was mostly more heavy singles, getting me back into a belt, and very light meet week. Obviously not much peaking is necessary for such a noob lol. Embarrassing admission….I shed a tear when I saw my name next to the word ""peak"" on a Google sheet 😅. 


Obviously everyone (including coach) advised to not cut weight for your first meet, but I was hovering at the cutoff for 72kg so I decided that I would be a 72kg (I'm finding this a good way to keep myself from overdoing it on the food and returning to old bad habits….I can't eat all the things, I exist as a 72kg. If I ever exist as anything else, it will be purposeful). Monday before the meet I weighed 160.8 lbs (72.94 kg). I ate low carb all week and limited water and salt on Thursday and Friday. 


**Meet Day**


Two weeks beforehand, I would nearly puke thinking about the meet. But that feeling was overpowered by the excitement as it got closer. I walked into that gym ready to rock….I had accepted that my back issues would hold me back, but I still had done everything I could do to prepare, missed only one training day in an entire year, and I just wanted to finally do this shit.


I rolled in to the 7 am weigh in hungry and thirsty but feeling good, and with my meet day starter pack (pedialyte, gatorade, chips, PB&amp;J, homemade rice Krispy treats, and skittles - all tips found here and served me well, ty). The volunteers were especially helpful and friendly; I'm unsure whether this is commonplace or if extra kid gloves were used for us rookies. Weighed in at 71kg then got in line for rack heights while sipping on pedialyte and taking a few naproxen and tylenol. Sat and forced down a little of all the food while chatting with a few other ladies and doing mobility stuff. Being a rookie meet, we were all very much in the same boat, and having nearly 2 hours of hanging out before lifting began seemed to calm all of our nerves to some extent. Rules meeting 30 min before start, which was very thorough, including standards for the lifts (I get it, but couldn't help but think someone done fucked up if any of this is new to them lol).


Downed a heaping scoop of pwo before warmups. I don't feel like I got the full experience of how warmups could be. My coach kind of took over one rack and directed a handful of us taking turns warming up with the same weights. I can see how warmups could be a problem depending on the amount of equipment and if you don't have an aggressive coach that is going to take care of making sure you get the time you need. However, he didn't have me warm up much. Iirc my last warm up was a single of 78% of my opener. I was in the fucking zone, ear buds blasting while coach would point at the bar and hold up his fingers of how many reps to do. Nothing in the world existed or mattered except the massacre I was about to go on (this was my mental narrative lol). Realized right before that first attempt that I felt zero back or radiating pain... adrenaline apparently cures sciatica lol.


I had asked coach not to tell me my expected attempts, and I only learned of my openers at weigh in.


Being able to stay in the zone and not pay attention to the order was alone worth having coach there. After every lift in my flight, he'd just hold up fingers with how many out I was.

[Here's all the attempts](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFDn1wfg8Pq/?igshid=1xt74vona0ezq)

⚪⚪⚪ 92.5 kg

⚪⚪⚪ 100 kg (idk what happened here, shouldn't have been so ugly...reason for conservative 3rd attempt)

⚪⚪⚪ 102.5 kg (1 lb PR, I love where I ask coach afterwards how much it was lol)


Watched the other flight squat and kept eating. Did a lot of cheering. Due to covid, we could only bring 2 ppl including coach. I don't even know who all these people yelling my name in all these vids are, twas a very small but very hyped group.


Bench warm ups flew, I blinked and it was time to lift. Ugh, my poverty bench….


⚪⚪🔴 42.5 kg (red light for ass coming up when bracing)

🔴⚪⚪ 45 kg (judge said wrong button pushed lol)

⚪⚪⚪ 47.5 kg (matched current 1RM)


More eating, pwo, sitting, and cheering. Why the hell am I genuinely so hyped for these ppl I just met or don't know? What an amazing atmosphere. 


I was dreading DLs. My once favorite and strongest lift was now my weakest and hadn't been trained in 3 months. I accepted mentally weeks ago that I would likely pull far below my 1rm. But, that last warm up flew *and there was no pain at all*. Every day in the week leading up to the meet, the pain was pretty bad in ADLs, so this was shocking.


⚪⚪⚪ 102.5 kg

⚪⚪⚪ 115 kg

⚪⚪⚪ 127.5 kg (6 lb PR, and fuck I'm happy. Coach actually put in for 125 kg, but switched it without telling me. I wish this vid lasted a few more seconds for when I start crying 🙈).


I lightly cried and entire body was slightly shaking for a few minutes, I didn't feel in control of it. I think it was a combo of happiness, exhaustion, adrenaline crash, and maybe some science/biology shit? The day was amazing, the meet itself was well done and very noob friendly, and it was some of the most fun I've ever had in my life.


While not huge PRs, I am absolutely thrilled with the numbers under the conditions. Being a retired couch potato, I feel good that I set a goal, consistently worked my ass off for 11 months, learned a sport, became somewhat competent in that sport, kept training through a pandemic and quarantine depression, AND kept going when there were days I could barely walk from this stupid sciatic nerve. I'm absolutely hooked, and getting into this has changed my life in sooooooo many ways. This is definitely a very healthy thing for how I view my weight/body...I wanna be and look strong, whatever form that takes, eating for fuel, etc. But ofc, I would be remiss if I didn't admit part of the PLing appeal is the embracing of food 😅.


If you actually read all of this, then you're the one person 9 months from now googling ""michigan rookie Rumble"" and deciding whether to register (yeah, that was me too lol). Fucking do it. There were people weaker than me, people stronger than me. Some people didn't have belt and/or sleeves, and a few had a custom belt. But, it didn't matter at all, that is the absolute truth, don't let your numbers or inexperience hold you back. People you just met will be screaming for you as grind out that 3rd attempt, regardless of what's on the bar. One tip I would give….if I didn't have a coach attending with me, I would hire a handler for the day (maybe a coach that will already be there with another athlete?). I could have done this without him, but there are a fair amount of moving parts that would be a big distraction from what you're there to do….move weight. Coach loaded all warm ups for me and told me how many reps to do (and he made sure we had a rack to do them on, legit concern). He let me know when my time to go was coming; otherwise I would've been squinting at a screen periodically while trying to stay in the zone. You have to put your next attempt in as you leave the platform...good luck making that decision, and converting to kgs quickly if you're murican lol. Coach made every decision for me and put in attempts while I did things like, go pee. I can't stress enough how much weight this takes off your shoulders.


If any of you actual regular users of this sub actually made it to the end, THANK YOU. While I now have a coach and am at a powerlifting gym (still have to give myself a pep talk before walking in, convince myself I belong there lol), this sub has been one of primary sources of information and has taught me who the good/bad resources are, especially while chugging along by myself at my chain gym. I'm still so so so weak and have sooooooo much to learn, but I swear to fucking God, I will be competitive-ish in masters in 2 years 💪😤",powerlifting,[FIRST MEET REPORT] USAPL Michigan Rookie Rumble 9/12/20 | 37F | 277.5 kg @ 71 kg | 273 wilks | total noob to meet in 11 months
1600044146,"Because of the mess that is USPA East right now, I ended up competing at an unsanctioned meet to see how my lifts were progressing.

**SQUAT (wrapped)**

1st attempt: 605/274.5 (good lift) - went well, no major hiccups.

2nd attempt: 630/285.8 (good lift) - also went well, felt relatively easy for a 2nd attempt, especially since I've only ever gone above 610 a handful of times.

3rd attempt: 650/295 (no lift) - felt like the strength was there but the loaders messed up my rack height and bar weight, which resulted in my standing in wraps waiting to lift for 5+ minutes. No complaints, I'll hit it next time.

**BENCH**

1st attempt: 385/174.6 (good lift) - felt a bit harder than usual.

2nd attempt 400/181.4 (no lift) - hand off was good, my back wasn't as tight as it should have been which resulted in me losing tension on the way up.

3rd attempt 400/181.4 (no lift) - exact same thing, compounded with the fatigue of trying it a 2nd time.

**DEADLIFT**

1st attempt: 615/279 (good lift) this was easier than it should have been, probably could have opened at 625ish, but hindsight is 20/20.

2nd attempt: 635/288 (good lift) felt about as easy as the opener, which made me decide to take a higher jump than planned for the 3rd attempt

3rd attempt: 665/301.6 (good lift) This was probably my favorite rep of all time, I couldn't hear or see anything on the way up, but it honestly felt like I could have pulled 700 pounds.

**OVERALL**

I'm happy with my performance, as of today I've added 230/104.3 to my total within the last 11 months, and I know I've got more to do. If this had been a USPA sanctioned meet I would have set 8 state records and 3 world records (junior/open deadlift and junior total).

First meet done, and it was awesome. Went 7/9 and took first (out of one) in the 110kg, Junior 20-23 class.

I ran the Barbell Medicine peaking program in the weeks leading up to this meet, and during it the only lift I was really confident in was deadlift, so I really surprised myself today and I couldn’t be happier.

SQUAT: 1st Attempt @207.5kg made, moved great, sunk it and made me real confident going forward.
         
               2nd Attempt @215kg redlighted, moved great too, but I jumped the rack command and therefore got red lighted. Honestly I wanted to have 227.5 be my third, but I was worried about not making it and getting stuck at 207.5 so I played it safe. Which brings me to...

              3rd Attempt @220kg made, and made me real happy. Squat overall felt amazing.

BENCH: 1st attempt @122.5kg made, felt great and gave me good confidence going forward.

               2nd attempt @127.5kg made, also felt great and made me overconfident going into my third...
  
                3rd attempt @132.5kg missed, only truly failed lift of the day. Gotta work on power off my chest, not much else to say. 

DEADLIFT: 1st attempt @220kg made, didn’t exactly fly up and I got one red light for apparently hitching slightly. Applied baby powder and moved on...

                   2nd attempt @227.5kg made, this one flew up and felt like cake, so I said screw it and decided to go all in on my third...

                  3rd attempt @240kg made, and I successfully shattered my old gym PR of 505lbs. This was by far my favorite lift on the day.

Finished with a 1295.126 total, a (unofficial) Wilks of 345.72, and a smile on my face. Overall a stellar first meet, and a great introduction to the sport. The gym that hosted was awesome, and I met some of the friendliest people who gave me some great advice (and back slaps).

I’m 17, 5’ 10”, 150 lbs (68 kg) and gaining weight. I started lifting in June and trying to bulk as much as I can.

My bench press went amazing, hit all three with a top of 72.5 kg. My pr in gym is a rough 80 but they were doing 2 second pauses at chest and I wanted to make sure I got them. 

Squat was even better, with a previous pr of 90, I got a third lift of 95 easily.

Deadlift, well, interesting. Deadlift is usually my best lift, but today I just wasn’t feeling it. I had a rough 165 kg a few weeks back but my form still isn’t the best. I ended up getting the first lift of 150, missed the second, and redid it at 157.5 for a third lift. 

Overall I had a great time and learned a lot about the community, and met some really cool people!

1599845980,"**About me:**

20 y/o, 6’0, 88kg (193lbs)

**TLDR:**

Gained 20 lbs squat, 15 bench, 20 deadlift. Overall a good introductory program into powerlifting. Definitely will work for early intermediated don’t know about advanced lifters.

**Background:**

Played baseball throughout high school and currently play at the college level. Started lifting around junior year but not super consistently. Going into freshman year of college was more consistent, was running the r/fitness PPL routine. Definitely got stronger but still didn’t really know what I was doing. During the spring of freshman year didn’t really workout because of baseball season then once the season ended began with 5/3/1. Ran that up until corona virus this year, was super consistent  I don’t think I missed a training day aside from a week long vacation, and made good progress. Then had to do mainly dumbbell work to maintain until I got all my home gym gear. Ran a LP program until my numbers were back up to where they were before shutdown then started Candito’s program. So this was the first time running a powerlifting so had pretty high expectations.

**Maxes before**

S: 145k (320lbs)

B: 102kg (225lbs)

D: 159kg (350lbs)

**Training Review:**

Candito uses a combination of DUP and block periodization. The first 2 weeks are higher volume more hypertrophy focused training and the last 3 are higher intensity. Overall I really liked the way he broke up the training and I never really got bored or burnt out. I’m just going to go briefly over how I felt each week of training was:

**Week 1:** 

This wee was pretty easy overall, but it was a productive week for getting introduced to higher frequency benching and just building up overall work capacity.

**Week 2:** 

This week was really focused on squats and pushing the reps. I really pushed the reps on the second squat session so I could get the 10 sets of 3. I think this really helped overall with working out kinks with form. My bench was also feeling pretty strong, weight that I normally was struggling with was feeling easier. I think that was mostly due to form, I was using leg drive way better.

**Week 3:** 

This week was like a mini deload, no optional accessories. I did throw in some curls cause they wouldn’t effect recovery and I want to have big arms. But this was a good transition to the higher intensity weeks as we worked up to some higher weight for the first time.

**Week 4:**

This week as really good, hit some weights that I hadn’t before or in a long time. My upper back spasmed the night before my heavy deadlift and squats but didn’t really effect me too much. Bench felt really strong hit 215lbs for 2 relatively easily.

**Week 5:** 

This was the last formal training week and I decided to just use the numbers I hit here as I didn’t really want to actually test my 1rm.

For squats I hit 310x4 which I hadn’t done in a long time and it was pretty easy probably rpe 8.5. First to reps were good last 2 my hips shot back a little but overall I was happy with it.

For bench I got 220x4, I hadn’t touched this weight before and was really happy with it. I could have been better on the bottom half of the lift but again overall it was great.

Then for deadlift I got 340x4 at rpe 9. The video looks like it was easier than it felt but it was definitely hard.

**Results:**

S: 154kg (340lbs)

B: 109kg (240lbs)

D: 168kg (370lbs)

**Final Thoughts:**

Overall I was really happy with how the program turned out. I think if I did a dedicated 1rm testing my maxes could be higher but I’m still happy with how they turned out. After reading a lot of reviews I was a little worried about bench. After running I do think that this is one of the better programs to run if you never done dedicated “powerlifting” or strength focused program. I will definitely run this program again.",powerlifting,(Program Review)Jonnie Candito 6 Week Intermediate

1599684095,"First off - this was my first really big meet. I've got to say that it seemed really smooth to me despite all of the coronavirus challenges. Things were still a bit crowded. My personal preference would have been to spread things out even more and have no spectators at all, but I get that I’m more cautious than most.

**Background:**    
I started working out with no definite goals back in school in 2010-2011. I actually got pretty fit at that time but wasn’t moving significant weight. I got a job that took massive hours on an irregular schedule for a few years and workouts were a distant memory. I started lifting again, with a trainer at a corporate gym, in early 2015. He was a powerlifter and had done a couple of meets. I started doing more workouts around the big three. I wasn’t ever going to compete. I just liked being strong. In 2017, I changed jobs, moved across the state, and found another trainer at another corporate gym. We did a lot of unorthodox workouts and I kept working on my big three lifts on my own. It took me far to long to realize that I wasn’t going to get what I wanted out of a chain gym.

I wasn’t that strong. I decided I wanted to compete.

I was finally moving non-embarrassing weight. I found The Dirty Gym - a local barbell club that was hosting a competition. I ended up working with Dillon, a trainer there, and said goodbye to corporate gyms forever. When I went to actually register for that competition though, I found out it was full. In retrospect, I’m glad it all worked out like it did. I had a much better first meet than I would have otherwise. Dillon put 100 pounds on my squat in six months preparing for my first meet. When I found out that 2020 DT Nationals were just down the road from me, that became the overriding goal.

**Training:**  
I’ve still got an irregular schedule and a demanding job. I’ve got three kids now. I like to call my current program “Do whatever Dillon tells me to do.” So far, it’s been working pretty well. I’m really grateful to have the ability to offload all of the planning and cognitive work to someone else. I had to cut a bit of weight going into this one. I only needed to drop from 113kg. I learned that carbohydrate manipulation is the way to go for me. I ended up weighing in at 107.7.

**Them Lifts**    
**Squat**

A nice opener. I tipped the bar a bit and got stuck on the rack coming out. The lift itself was fine. Dropped the rack for the next go.  Got on the board and let the nerves settle a bit. Already 5kg over my first meet.

[240kg/529lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WcyFvYCeGE&amp;t=64m52s) 🔴🔴🔴    
It‘s good to know I can discover new and interesting errors on meet day. Hit depth fine, but managed to come up out of the hole slow and bob the bar halfway up. Rightly called for a double descent.

Finished strong. 5kg PR. Overall, I was really happy with my deadlifts. At my first meet, I couldn’t even get my gym PR because I was out of gas at the end of the day. On an unrelated note, I'd like to complement the spotter behind me on his professionalism. Dude didn't even flinch when I... uh... violated his airspace. Whomever you are, young man, I owe you an apology beer.

Overall, I’m happy with the day. I pushed myself and ended up 7/9 with a 630kg total. That’s a jump of 52.5kg from my first meet! I got to take some hardware home as well. I could have done a bit better if I’d not gotten greedy on bench. If I’d not bobbled the second squat I might have picked up a few more kilos there as well.

I’m waiting on the official results to find out where I ended up in the open and on the overall Masters list. There were some Strong Old Dudes lifting that rocked me on the McCulloch scale.

1599667797,,powerlifting,Akshay Kumar की 6 Tips Fat कम करने के लिए ।। Akshay Kumar Fitness Motivation
1599663067,"On Labor Day, I competed in USPA Drug Tested Nationals in Columbus, Ohio. I took 3rd in my weight class (SHW) and had a great experience, but am disappointed in my squats on the day. My goal was to hit 272.5kg/200kg/272/5kg (600/440/600). I didn't hit my goals, but I had a great experience training through quarantine, competing in an open nationals, and balancing studying for the bar and training.

Attempts:

Squat 1: 245kg - make - harder than it should have been, especially because I easily doubled this weight a couple weeks prior.

Squat 2: 265kg - missed - got it about halfway and failed. Surprised because this was a number I was very confident I would hit coming into the day.

Squat 3: 265kg - missed - barely got it out of the hole. Lost tension and descended too quick.

Bench 1: 187.5kg - easy make - felt confident in this, have hit it for a triple recently.

Bench 2: 197.5kg - make - this was a 2.5kg PR and felt good.

Bench 3: 202.5kg - miss - I originally wanted 200kg, but the 197.5 felt good and I thought a 5kg jump was good. Will hit this soon.

Deadlift 1: 245kg - easy make

Deadlift 2: 262.5kg - tough, but moved well. This was a 2.5kg pr.

Deadlift 3: 272.5kg - made - absolute grinder, but was very excited to finally hit 600. Been a goal for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

Training:

This was the longest, most stressful training block of my life. During quarantine in March/April/May, I was fortunate to buy a power bar and a rack and some plates. I was lifting in a friend's garage for most of that time and was feeling amazing. I was primed for the meet on June 14, but it was delayed because of Covid.

After the meet got delayed, I got lackluster, because I did not think I would be able to compete. The bar exam in my state got delayed to two days after the meet, and I could  not justify the time off for the meet and the distraction. About a month out, the bar exam got delayed further and I was able to resume my training. Unfortunately, I had dropped 25ish pounds from my last meet prep and was severely de-trained. I had spent time in the summer hiking in Colorado and Utah. I put about 10 pounds back on, which helped the deadlift but felt rough on the squat.

The weeks leading up to the meet were productive for training, but I did have some nagging injuries. I mostly ran a 3 on/ 1 off split, where I would Squat then Bench then deadlift with bands dynamically, rest, then do that split on max effort. Basic linear progressions and accessories. I ran this for my last meet and had massive PRs so I was excited to try it again.

In training I hit a 405 triple on bench, a 525 triple squat, and a 525 triple deadlift about 3 weeks out. I hit 415 double bench, 540 double squat and deadlift 2 weeks out.

&amp;#x200B;

Meet Day:

Amazing experience and meet. Chico and Maggie at Columbus Lifting Co. were unreal. They were so helpful throughout the entire process and put on an amazing meet. I cannot imagine the struggles they experienced when prepping this meet with Covid and the regulations and stress of the delay. Unbelievable job.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as health, they had great procedures set up and seemed to be in total compliance with the health department. I know they split the ballroom up with a plexiglass divider to enhance the viewing experience and still accommodate social distancing. Everything about this meet was professional grade and I cannot wait to do another one with them.",powerlifting,[MEET REPORT] USPA Drug Tested Nationals| M | 715kg/1576lbs @ 155.6kg | 459 Wilks

1599510629,"info about me: 16, 195cm/6 '4, 100kg/220lbs. Ive always been chubby but very slightly muscled. I started doing fitness a year ago but only did machines and stuff. Ive been playing basketball for about 4.2 years. After the gyms opened back up here i started doing actual heavy exercises like bench press, squats, deadlifts. I barely use machines  anymore. Im still kinda weak imo but lets get to the point. btw i go to the gym about 3-4 times a week and do ppl.

Today i just had a normal legday. Although it was the first time i did squats and deadlifts back to back. Normally i just do deadlifts on pull day and squats on leg day. So started with squats i did 4x57.5kg. After that i did deadlifts. Started with 70kg on set 1. 110kg on set 2. 115 on set 3 i started seeing stars after dropping the weight but ignored it first bad thing. then i did 120kg on set 4. I did it with seeing stars for the first 4 reps then on the fifth and last rep boom. I pulled the weight up and after that i fainted. All i know is the weight dropped. Everything became blurry like a rave scene from a movie where the protagonist got some weird drugs. I saw lights and blurrs. I fell backwards first then somehow i dont know how i fell forward. Few seconds pass and i wake up sitting on the floor with a scratch on my left ear and left hand. Only 2 people saw it which was weird tho no one else even gave a glance. I thought i must be imagining it but no i did actually faint. After that happened i just reracked the weight and went tk the changing room and just sat for 15 or so mins just drinking water. I got back and did some leg extensions and leg curls then went home. 

My question now is did i do something wrong other than ignoring the stars i saw during set 3 and 4. And did i actually faint or did something else happen. And should i do anything now that im home? I already heard to drink something sugary and sleep with feet up.

TL:DR
Fainted at deadlifting 120kg. Ignored stars. Went to changing room sat for 15 mins drinking water. Did leg curls and leg extensions. Now at home. What did i do other than ignoring stars? Did i actually faint or did something else happen? And should i do anything at home. I heard to drink something sugary and sleep with feet up.",powerlifting,Fainted during deadlift

1598920609,"I have been lifting for the past 2 years, strictly powerlifting for a year of that. When gyms reopened I took it fairly easily and built my strength back up but now I am unable to deadlift or squat right now because of this extremely difficult tightness around my lower back and glute area strictly on the left side.

[where my injury is located](https://imgur.com/gallery/gHOaegt)

Above I have left a picture of where the feeling is located starting from the red dot and then pulling in the direction of the arrow, it feels like two ends need to be grabbed an pulled apart or untied? Its difficult to describe, sometimes when I walk a sensation shoots down my hips, hamstring or quad and if I stand still and try to lift my left knee without assistance my left hip just cramps extremely badly like nothing I’ve ever felt before.

I’ve tried anterior pelvic stretching and many others along with foam rolling and lacrosse balling the areas affected but nothing has really done much, yesterday night I had to take some meds in order for me to actually sleep cuz the pain was very annoying.

I just want to clarify the pain stays no matter what position I am, be it lying down, sitting or standing however, the pain is never so bad that I cant actually physically walk, sit etc it only stops me from deadlifting, squatting or bending over.

1598787822,"Hello friends! I'm fairly new to the world of powerlifting and lifting in general. I started lifting to loose weight, to be fully honest. I'm 5'11"" and used to weight 134 kg. Now, after about 1 year of playing rugby and 6 months of working out between gym and home, I am around 117 kg. Dream is to be between 80 and 90, whilst still being big enough to look like a bear. You know what I mean, most of us big boys have been compared to animals at some point or another. Also I'm eating a calorie deficit, about 2200 per day.
Also also, my training includes a daily PPL routine where I do cardio for 30 minutes, then focus on Push/Pull/Legs specifically with one additional exercise from the other groups just to keep all muscle group active during the week. 


Problem is: when I deadlift my pulling strength seems to fail after a few reps, and I know it's not the weight because when I deadlift with straps I can pull 140 kg easy, however when its just my hands I can't do more than 120, and that's on a good day. 


So, what do I do? I suspect its my positioning of body posture and or hand posture, but I tried it all and can't seem to work it out. Maybe its because I am cutting but trying to increase weighted reps at the same time so maybe my muscles cannot get enough nutrients to develop enough to pull that kinda weight on their own?",powerlifting,How to improve grip strength and body posture?

1598731581,"In a deep dive around the internet I came across Rickey Crain’s website where he lists hundreds of video recordings of old meets he has for sale. I have a friend who was a competitor in college so I thought a cool present might be a video of her competing about 20 years ago; she’s mentioned several times she doesn’t have much in the way of pictures and memorabilia from that time in her life.

I first emailed him in February of 2019. He said they were “changing their DVD ordering system” so should check back “in a month or so.” Following that I’d reach out more like every other month, and I’d hear various answers about how the particular meet I was asking for wasn’t available, or how they were trying to go digital with everything and weren’t ready yet.

In June he told me they had the meet I wanted, cool. But there was a problem with the labels and it would take “30-45 days before it is ready.” It’s been a year and a half, another month or so didn’t bother me. He asked for my credit card info and everything over email without mentioning how much it would be, and I gave it to him.

He charged me $80. Now, that’s a lot of money for 2 DVDs, but it’s not a lot of money in the grand scheme of the universe and I don’t mind it at all. Honestly at this point I’m really just more emotionally invested and morbidly curious about seeing it through.

What irked me a little is that after a year and a half of being in touch, and him taking sometimes months to get back to me, the money was charged to my card in (not exaggerating) roughly two minutes. And since then, well over 30-45 days, more than enough time to print out some labels I also made clear I didn’t really care about, he still says he’s “working on it.”

Just out of curiosity I researched him a bit and it seems like he’s gone through some stuff and I’m not indifferent to that. This isn’t a rant or anything, just maybe a PSA about giving this guy your money. Wouldn’t be surprised if I never see that DVD.",powerlifting,Getting scammed by Rickey Dale Crain

1598434764,"Calling a deadlift a pull is, imo, an extremely dangerous concept/idea. 

In a deadlift movement pattern, the only moving parts are the legs/hips. They are pushing the ground away. In effect, the deadlift is simply a leg press but with the weight attached to your arms via your hands. 

The throwing around of the idea of pulling the weight, or having deadlifts on pull days, is extremely dangerous because you do not trigger the adequate amount of leg drive and abdominal compression. This leads to lower back rounding, loss of the neutral lumbar curve, as well as excessive thoracic rounding as well.

Just try cuing leg drive instead of pull and the difference will be night and day. You will lift less but your back will definitely not give way and you will infinitely decrease the chances of messing up your spinal discs.",powerlifting,Deadlifts should not be called a pull.

I'm not expecting it to add insane amounts to my bench, I'm really just looking for a way to get more volume closer to my max, and possibly to overload my max. Second, if it would be helpful, which one should I get, the reactive or the original? How much difference is there between these two versions?

1598213943,"Tl;dr at the bottom

I haven't worked out in a year. The last 6 months were because of Covid closing gyms, the 6 months before that because nursing school ate up every second I had to spare.

I'm a 19F, 5'5, 150lbs, BMI: 24, Body Fat Percentage: 21.

I used to weightlift and power lift quite a bit, I rock climbed a ton, dabbled in Crossfit until I realized my local instructors had no clue what they were doing, and did some cycling and running. Powerlifting has always been my favorite method of working out (I LOVE deadlifts!). I work out primarily for stress release. Nothing does that better than moving big shit. I also have loose kneecaps, and blasting my quads helps to prevent me from dislocating anything. I also like having useful muscle that allows me to go about my day much more easily than otherwise. 

I'm not looking to compete (at least not right now), I just want to move big shit, stress release, and gain useful muscle. I also sleep better if I am working out, which is really great. I'm also not looking to lose weight. I eat pretty well, higher protein, lower(ish) carb, and I know how fuel myself for workouts.

I'm moving into my dorm at school in 5 days, and I'm trying to find a good, simple, straightforward workout program that I can bust out in 45 minutes to an hour. I've looked at doing a 5x5 routine because it seems very straightforward and would allow me time, in the beginning, to get my form back on point. All the squats are scaring me, but I also know that they will help me out a lot. I know my body responds well to the training type/load increases that are used in a 5x5.

I also know that I have a really hard time activating my glutes. I'm wondering if adding a 1x5 of barbell hip thrusts in the B workout (Squat, OHP, Deadlift) at least for the first couple of weeks would help with that. I've always had to supplement, even when I was working out a lot. I just don't want to blow out my lower back because my glutes aren't able to help with the other lifts enough, and then damage something as the weight increases. I'm going to take this slow, since I know most of my muscle mass is gone and it will be hard to build it back up again.

I also can only work out in mornings, and I'm wondering if a 5x5 would tire me out for the day. I love working out in the mornings (5am usually), I'm just curious if anyone has had trouble with feeling exhausted for the rest of the day. 

tl;dr getting back to lifting, looking at trying a 5x5 to build back to the strength I had. Maybe adding a 1x5 of barbell hip thrusts for a couple weeks to support my glutes which don't like to activate. Advice on that, and any other things I should know about a 5x5 before I get started?",powerlifting,"Getting back to lifting, looking for advice"

1598190562,"**BACKGROUND**

I am a 25 year old recent law school graduate and soon-to-be attorney. I've been training off and on for high school sports and such for about 8 years but only training for powerlifting for about 3-4 years. This was my first meet.

**MEET PREP**

Last fall I started working with a coach and I planned on competing last spring but Covid changed that. I am coached by u/mscullin75, who I initially met here on reddit but have since come to know and be great friends with in real life. He is a great coach; he really takes the time to help me improve and become a better lifter in all facets (the lifts themselves, the mental side of things, understanding why I'm doing what I'm doing, but I digress). My programming is personalized so I won't really go into it too much, but pre-taper &amp; peak I was lifting 5x a week (2-3x squat, 2x bench, 1x deadlift).

I didn't cut any weight for this meet per se, I just lost a few of the quarantine pounds I gained. But I don't feel like that had any negative impact on my training or meet performance.

**THE MEET**

This meet was held in Manning, SC at Breaking Bars gym. It was run very well &amp; very efficiently (except the bathroom plumbing was an issue and everyone in the entire gym had to use the same single toilet, you can imagine the smell in there by the end of the day). There were some dropouts due to Covid so things moved quickly. 2 flights, around 30 lifters overall.

There were 5 lifters in the 100kg class, including a couple of heavy hitters who I had no chance at beating. But I just wanted to have a solid first meet and get myself on the board so I have something to improve upon going forward.

All third attempts, and second DL attempt, on: [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CENEq2lgNqK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). 

**SQUAT**

1st attempt: 202.5/446.3 - Good lift. There was a misload (that thankfully was noticed before I got under the bar) and I missed the rack coming in. What a first attempt.

2nd attempt: 207.5/457.3 - Good lift. I went a bit too deep which made it more difficult than anticipated.

3rd attempt: 210/462.3 - Good lift. Felt easier than my second attempt because I didn't sink it.

**BENCH**

1st attempt: 152.5/336.1 - Good lift. Not much to say about bench, it's my best lift and I knew I had these in the bag.

2nd attempt: 160/352.6 - Good lift.

3rd attempt: 165/363.6 - Good lift. A grind, but I didn't break down and just kept pushing.

**DEADLIFT**

1st attempt: 215/473.9 - Good lift. Flew up, but that was the plan.

2nd attempt: 227.5/501.4 - Good lift. Better than I'd hit it in training.

3rd attempt: 237.5/523.5 - No lift. My only miss of the day. I locked it out but called for hitching. It wasn't egregious, but I get why I was called for it.

**OVERALL**

I went 8/9, totaled 602.5/1328.3 at 94.7/208.8 with a (new) Wilks of 450.6. I placed 3rd out of 5 lifters in the 100kg class. And I'm fired up. I couldn't have asked for the day to go better, I know going forward where I need to improve, and I can't wait to compete again.",powerlifting,[MEET REPORT] [FLAIR REQUEST] USPA South Carolina State Meet | M | 602.5kg/1328.3lbs @ 94.7kg/208.8lbs | 450.6 Wilks
1598190095,"Apologies if this is against the rules. 
Why am I weak af in the gym with almost all lifts? I've been going to the gym for about 5 years now. My totals are around 110kg bench, 140kg squat, and I don't deadlift but I'd imagine it's around 160kg. Obviously they're not too bad, but I play rugby at a fairly high level, and compared to even some of the smaller players on my team, those numbers are pretty awful. 

I'm 201cm and 124kg, and outside of the gym I'm quite strong i.e in scrums, rucks, mauls etc. but in the weightroon I just can't get my numbers up. 

Would it be because of my long limbs making a mechanical disadvantage, or perhaps is it down to me having poor form.

I accidentally did something like this once but i think the contrast wasnt big enough. I felt like all the capacity built over a year with kind of linear periodization was turned into a explosive max strength in a couple of months. But my progress in squat at least stopped and slowed in other lifts. I think due to lower volume for too long.

Now that ive built some new capacity and learned a lot of good form would you just switch and start doing ME and DE for a few months and then test 1RM?

1597584140,"I wrote this to clarify my own priorities, but I hope other people might find it useful too. The criteria on these lists are somewhere on the spectrum of principles, methodologies, and rules to live by, and they're all ways to become the best powerlifter that your genetics will allow. If you follow each one, I think you would be doing the absolute most to ensure your success.

The Necessary category is for methodologies that I think are critical for improvement, and if even one is discarded (excepting supplements because their effect is fairly negligible, and rehab if you don't have any injuries,) you're shooting yourself in the foot. The Ideal category includes methods that will become more and more important as your gains slow down, eventually becoming Necessary as well.

# Necessary Methodologies for:

* **Programming:** Use a simple, well-regarded program that’s easy to follow.
* **Technique:** Use technique that’s comfortable for you while meeting competition form.
* **Body Maintenance (Mobility/Rehab):** If you have any difficulty performing a movement, avoid it or find a rehabilitative exercise that will alleviate your difficulty. Don't do any movement just because you feel like you should.
* **Cortisol Management:** Sleep as much as possible.
* **Body Composition:** If you need to cut, then cut, and if you need to bulk, bulk. If you need to stay the same, do that.
* **Nutrition:** Eat your required amount of protein, and eat an amount of food commensurate with your body composition goals.
* **Supplementation:** Use proven supplements (creatine, caffeine, etc.)

# Ideal Methodologies for:

* **Programming:** Consider hiring a coach. Use micro, meso, and macrocycles with the appropriate balances of exercise choice, volume, intensity, and frequency within the confines of your recovery abilities and personal schedule.
* **Technique:** Learn to use your leverages as perfectly as your body and the rules will allow. 
* **Body Maintenance (Mobility/Rehab):** Identify potential problem areas in your joints, musculature, or range of motion and address them to preclude issues. Utilize advanced recovery methods such as sports massage, Theragun massage, sports physiotherapist, physical therapy, contrast bathing, and cryotherapy.
* **Cortisol Management:** Reduce internal stressors with your preferred methods; i.e. positive self-talk, visualization, therapy, and other mental health strategies. Similarly with external stressors, reduce or eliminate unnecessary obligations that sap your time or energy, and limit interaction with people who have ambivalent or negative attitudes about your journey. Keep a supportive circle around you.
* **Body Composition:** Identify your most appropriate weight class. Become as muscular as possible at or slightly above the cutoff for your weight class.
* **Nutrition:** Consider hiring a coach. Eat the requisite ratio of carbs and fats in line with your performance and body composition goals. Eat your meals with optimal timing. Eat high-quality foods.
* **Supplementation:** Test your blood to identify and correct micronutrient deficiencies. Experiment with other supplements that may have beneficial properties. Use what works, discontinue what doesn’t.

I think it's a neat idea to rank principles by importance. I see it all the time when talking about nutrition (calories&gt;macronutrients&gt;micronutrients&gt;meal timing&gt;supplementation) but not about everything involved in a powerlifting success story. I'd love to see what a more experienced lifter would have on their list, so please share if you're willing. Thanks for reading!",powerlifting,Ranking Methodologies for Powerlifting Success

1596766947,"Just got my new Titan multi-angled bar in (took 4 months, fuck corona) and decided to swap wide grip incline presses with the widest neutral grip on the bar for volume today. Triceps annihilated, shoulders feel amazing, and surprisingly the chest contraction was intense. Far more than my usual pressing, even without focusing on MMC it was 9/10. Wondering who here uses this during the off season and then swaps to a straight bar for specificity work during a peaking block? How’s the carryover? 

Also, do you use any other alternative equipment to train during off season? I use an SSB, trap bar, and probably from now on the multi grip bar. Just wondering what everyone’s favorite tool is to push their totals up while reducing a bit of risk factor associated with PL.",powerlifting,Bench Press: Straight Bar or Neutral/Angled for off-season work?

Hey everyone. I'm new to Powerlifting. Just transferred from calisthenics a month ago and I have a few questions about my programming and progress.

Yesterday I tried deadlift for the first time and got 205 x 5 @ 160lb BW. My goal is that in the next year I get it to 315 x 5 while maintaining my bodyweight. My plan is to get the weight up to 250lbs in the next 2 months and increase the reps to 15 so I'll reduce risk of injury after adding weight.

I plan on keep adding weights once I get my PR to 15 reps. At the same time, I was wondering whether I should deadlift on Back day or leg day (I currently deadlift after squats). I just want to reduce the risk of injury and add weights safely while maintaining body weight. Any diet recommendations since I heard with powerlifting in general I shouldn't be on the caloric deficit? Thanks",powerlifting,Deadlift Program

1596627536,"I'm a college student with a part-time job beside school, and due to work I'm considering changing my gymtimes from late afternoon / early evening to the very morning. You can see lot of early birds in the gym who advocates a morning gym over an evening one: it definitely wakes you up, have good health benefits etc. What about heavy lifting? I've read articles e.g in terms of burning energy, powerlifting sessions are more effective in the late afternoon, since you've already eaten 2 main meals plus 1-2 additional high calory snacks, therefore you have more energy compared to a person who just woke up, had a small breakfast then hit the gym for the same high volume powerlifting session. However, I want to find people who would debate this statement.

I've always loved a good morning exercise, whether it's a morning run, swimming, or shooting some balls on the nearest basketball court.

First started squatting low bar, got up to around 375 lbs for an estimated max (345 lbs x 4). 7 months ago I completely switched to high bar with the intent to make my quads humongous. At first I was way weaker, probably a 315 max, but within 2 months I caught up to my Low Bar max and fast forward to today I maxed out at 425 lbs. Now I’m debating the idea of switching back to Low Bar as pretty much every powerlifter I see squats Low Bar.

I’m thinking about getting back into it; I am less bulky than a year ago thanks to cardio but I still retained a lot of strength and muscle mass, and I did some paused DLs at 225-235 in June that felt good for someone who wasn’t lifting consistently. 

My university is online this semester and my overprotective mom doesn’t want me to get a gym membership because of the risk of COVID from shared gym equipment, so I’ll likely be getting more 45 plates for my basement “gym” setup. I can deadlift down there, albeit not more than 145 because of the lack of weights, and I can also bench (not the best bench but it’ll do), but I have no squat rack. I have some free weights that I can squat with but what is the best substitute for what I would do for squats? There’s no way I can afford or fit a whole rack. I don’t think I can do body weight squats with 250 lbs of plates.

In August I had to stop, started training some calisthenic style stuff at home, built a good foundation from essentially nothing over the next two months. I could do a few pushups and a pull up.   

End of November, I returned to the gym this time with the sole aim of building strength. I started on the Blaha 5x5 program, saw my bench go from 30kg to 67.5kg, squat from 50kg to 110kg and Deadlift go from 60kg to 125kg. I had to stop due to covid and lockdowns.   

I trained calisthenics pretty hardcore from april through to july and now can finally return to the gym. My bench and deadlift have actually increased, bench 1RM is now 80kg and deadlift 1RM is now 135kg, my squat is around 102.5kg.

1596157492,"Hi all,

I haven’t been lifting much in the past several months however I have plans to get back into training when my uni gym opens back up. 

Instead of PL I have picked up roller skating. The first thing that I noticed was my knee valgus has reared it’s ugly head in yet another sport. It’s been a problem since I first started squatting a few years ago, progressed to even caving while conventional deadlifting. It’s become awfully discouraging, I feel like I have no athleticism whatsoever and that I’m doomed to the land of valgus forever. I’m dreading getting back into lifting because of this. 

My history of attempting to find a resolution:
- Every warm up session beginning with banded clam shells, goblet squats, monster walks, hip thrusts, single leg rdls (obv no band).
- specific incorporation of adductor machine, heavy hip thrusts, widened stance squat variations (esp box squats), even banded deadlifts. Basically any movement requiring glutes that I can band, I have tried. 
- lowering the weight and training up when the valgus is controlled (never got controlled so I just gave up after many stints of continuously going back to an empty barbell for months at a time).

No dice. 

I’ve seen hundreds of how to videos, articles, etc but haven’t seen/heard many success stories. So has anyone got one to offer? I’d love to know what was the key to your success, and how long it took. 

Ps: I’ve never experienced any knee pain, I’m just trying to avoid it.",powerlifting,Has anyone successfully corrected knee valgus?

I’m just wondering if anyone has firsthand experience with using medical marijuana and competing in tested federations. I use MM as a stress reliever as well as my main source for sleep regularity. I’ve been cycling off bc I have a competition the 15th of August, but it’s been very difficult for me to come clean. 

I don’t really care about “beating” a drug test, if I have to go clean I will, but I just want to know if the 150ng/mL is correct? I’m just worried (I intend to set a state bench press record) that I’ll get popped for weed if I decide to go back to smoking.

1595814034,"This past weekend I competed at a WNPF meet in Tifton, Ga. This was perfect for my first meet because it wasn’t very far from where I live. I have been in the gym and powerlifting for 10 months now. For my prep I just ran Canditos 6 week intermediate twice. 

I competed in the 275 pound/124kg Junior division. This was a very small meet (50 lifters total) but it was a good atmosphere.  Everyone involved with the meet was required to wear masks and they took everyone’s temperatures at the door. 

I went 8/9 and totaled 1385lbs/628kg at 272lbs/123kg body weight. This gives me a 358.9 Wilks. I also set two all time PR’s in the squat and deadlift.

My current max squats training weight 45Kg 5RM.


1. So whenever Im doing squats with heavy weights, my knees always cave in. I made sure that weight is distributed evenly across my feet tripods, what would be the problem in here and what to do to fix this problem? 
That doesnt happen when working with light weights.

Squats: 1: 270kg 2: 285kg 3: 295kg/650lbs

Bench: 1: 170kg 2: 175kg 3: 180kg/396lbs

Deadlifts: 1: 250kg/551lbs 2: 270kg fail 3: 280kg fail

Probably the best meet of my life, even though I failed miserably on deadlifts. Lost my grip on second and third attempt, which brought my total down by a lot. Other than that everything felt great and the only thing I regret is not attempting 300kg on squats, since I think I had it in me today. I'll crush it later this year though, but it would be cool to get it before I turn 20(tomorrow).

If I had gotten my deadlifts this would have been a 65kg total PR, which feels amazing after basically standing still in everything but bench for 2 years. Below I'll write in broad terms what has changed for me recently in regards to my approach to training compared to recent years:

What I've done differently for squats the last 6 months compared to earlier in my training career is basically doing quality over quantity. I'm not hitting nearly as much volume on squats as I used to, but my focus during my workouts is much better than earlier. This is something I think most people go through as they start moving past the intermediate stage and into more advanced territory. I know I can still make great gains and this shows that, but I need to be more mindful of exactly what I'm doing. I can't just show up, put in the work and be gone. Sure, some sessions are like that, but actually focusing and lifting with intent is something I think has helped a ton. My recovery is also much better. When I started eating 300-400g of protein a day like lately it felt like my squat really skyrocketed. Helps with all lifts of course, but especially with my squat.

For bench, I've probably written this elsewhere but I basically just do much more volume than most people. 4 days a week, 40+ working sets a week, most of it very close to failure. When I started doing that roughly a year ago, my bench started taking off and I've increased it by 5-10kg every 2 months or so since. I'm running sheiko, but I think it's more the layout rather than the actual program that makes the difference if that makes sense. A good rule of thumb is: ""Why am I doing pressing exercise X, when I can do some kind of barbell bench instead?"".

I haven't really found the key to deadlifting yet although I've made some gains there aswell.

To summarize:

Squat: less volume, more focused, better recovery.

Bench: All the volume

Deadlift: ???

1595198212,"**PREP**

This was an interesting prep, I signed up for the meet only 18 days out, while already in the middle of a hypertrophy block. Also, I've been lifting in my 3rd floor apartment bedroom, so instead of having the ability to comp style deadlift, I had been focusing on RDLs/Stiff Leg/Extreme Tempo deadlifts. I only had 3 real competition style sessions between March and this meet. /u/agent21emh was able to write me up a peaking protocol that I think ended up working really well. My goals coming into the meet were a 1300 lbs total, then a 400 wilks, then a 336 pound bench press.

**MEET**


Once again I used /u/rawrylynch water cutting protocol (https://sisyphusstrength.com/blog/2018/6/25/how-to-water-cut-like-a-pro) to cut from 188lbs/85.2kg, and weighed in at 82.5kg. Rehydrating, again, is something I need to get better at. Tried to get fluids and food in me as fast as possible and ended up getting sick, but after that I was feeling good.

**SQUAT** 

ATTEMPT 1: 200kg/441 lbs 

https://streamable.com/o6edaj

Had hit this for a triple and a handful of singles during the weeks leading up. Felt good and strong so we stuck to the planned 2nd.

ATTEMPT 2: 210kg/463 lbs

https://streamable.com/rkg121

https://streamable.com/mi8ru5

Had not hit this weight for a full year, was my previous meet PR. I sort of lost a bit of tightness during the descent and sunk it a bit too far, making it a bit more of a fight than I'd hoped for. Decided to take our more conservative jump for the 3rd attempt.

ATTEMPT 3: 217.5kg/479 lbs

https://streamable.com/1glrg0

https://streamable.com/hjcw84

I love powerlifting. 3rd attempts are always a ton of fun. This is a 7.5kg meet PR, I think we made the right call in getting everything we could out of squat and going 3/3.

**BENCH PRESS** 

ATTEMPT 1: 140kg/308 lbs

https://streamable.com/nw7yji

https://streamable.com/dbve1i

This was a 2.5kg meet PR. Had hit this a number of times in the past few months, and it felt good today so we kept with the plan for my 2nd attempt.

ATTEMPT 2: 147.5kg/324 lbs

https://streamable.com/i1pyq3

https://streamable.com/mpp84p

10kg over my previous meet best. Really had to think about how I wanted to attack my 3rd after this. I'm pretty good at grinding through tough benches, but our plan really was contingent on me going 3/3 on bench. Originally we called for 150kg/330lbs, but went into the back room and figured I have no idea when the next chance is I'll have to compete, and I wanted to break the state record of 150kg, so we bumped my 3rd attempt up.

ATTEMPT 3: 152.5kg/336 lbs

https://streamable.com/12n47s

https://streamable.com/4y8nlb

Was very happy about this. Previous gym best was an extremely shaky 330 lbs, and this bench gave me all of the Junior records for my state, and put me in a good position for my main goal of a 1300 lbs total.

**DEADLIFT**

ATTEMPT 1: 212.5kg/468 lbs

https://streamable.com/11gdyb

https://streamable.com/ec27uy

Like I said previously, did not have a ton of competition deadlift training coming into this meet. I knew I was not going to hit a PR on this lift today, and I know deadlift has always caused me such a hard time. Picked an opener that I thought was safe and it moved nicely. 

ATTEMPT 2: 220kg/485 lbs

https://streamable.com/y57ka1

https://streamable.com/q837jk

Secured the 1300 lbs total with this pull. Now I had nothing to lose with going for the 400 wilks.

ATTEMPT 3: 230kg/507 lbs

https://streamable.com/v1tcl6

https://streamable.com/t2p36p

Got it! This was only 5kg/11 lbs under my all time best, and with only a few actual sessions coming in. Was a bit of a fight past the knees but I was lucky enough to get through it.

**RESULTS**

Went 9/9 with 27 white lights. Met all of my goals, which was a 1300+ total, a 400 wilks, and the state record for bench. I was so happy to have the chance to compete again after a year off. I think the meet was extremely well run, and the majority of the people (Noriega the exception) there were doing a good job with the masks/distancing/cleaning. 

**WHAT'S NEXT**

Keep training in my bedroom I guess. Would like to compete again before the end of the year but we will see how things play out.",powerlifting,[MEET REPORT] USAPL NH/VT State Championships | 83kg Raw Junior | 600kg @ 82.5kg | 401.94 Wilks/83.31 IPF Points

I used to powerlift 3-4 days a week fairly regularly but sometime in late 2019, I lost my gym mojo. I've been really sedentary that past 5 months and am the weakest, unhealthy, and emaciated I've been for a long while. I was my strongest around this time in 2019 with a 175 OHP 255 Bench, 375 squat, and 425 deadlift. My current numbers are roughly 75-80% of that now. Anyhow, a part of me wants to get back into powerlifting, but another part of me is really discouraged due to how weak I've gotten and not knowing if I'd be able to go to the gym as frequently as I used to due to covid. Anyone else in a similar predicament? I'm also considering taking up a different sport. Maybe running and/or sprinting. I've been trying to get into bodyweight stuff, but it bores me.

1594752588,"So, with gyms closed in my area, along with many other areas, our options are limited. I have been going to the local track and doing sprints. I used to be a track runner in high school, so this was my go-to exercise method after the gyms closed.

During this time, I have been wondering if doing sprints (100 to 400 meters) would improve my lifts, if not at least my squat. I don't know a whole lot about slow/fast twitch muscle fibers and all that noise, but I just like to think about these kinds of things.

What do you guys think? I'd like to know your opinion and if you have any experience with this kind of thing. I enjoy doing sprints whether it helps or not, and any exercise is better than none.

1594655252,"Gonna be a longer post so thank you to those who read through it :)

First about myself:
Age: 22
Weight: 95kg around 15% bf
Height: 177cm
Experience: 7 years seriously in the gym and since the start of 2019 running specific powerlifting plans.

Did the 6 week strength from Candito with the Disbrow for bench for most of 2019. And currently finishing my first run of the Sheiko Advanced Medium Load. Absolutely love the Sheiko plan, saw some amazing squat gains and fairly good bench ones. Deadlift not so much as it's always been my easiest lift, dur to my long arms.

Current 1rpm:

Bench: 145kg
Squat low bar: 210kg
Deadlift conventional: 240kg

Now to my reason for this post. There is a meet in exactly 28 days, which perfectly coincides with the end of the competition cycle. Only problem is I am 2 kg to heavy. 

I have used my fair share of pre workouts over the years and also dabbled with Yohimbine Hcl on ots own. Now I also got my hands on some real Kaizen 8mg from Canada. 

My plan now would be to run a 200-500kcal deficit with a very low dose EC or YC stack. Under low dose I mean 8mg Ephe + 100m Caffeine two to three times per day, while cutting out any other stims. Or a 5mg Yohimbine Hcl + 100mg Caffeine over the day. 

Each supplemented with around 1 gram of Kalium and good amount of fish oil to keep the heart healthy.

As I already tested my response to Ephe with a 8mg plus 100mg as a pre workout, and felt fine compsred to the usual jitters I got on Yohimbine, I am more inclined towards Ephe. 

Oh and I got my heart checked and everything 5 days ago, got no existing heart condition plus like I said I am not new to stimulants in general.

But I wanted to check in with the more experienced crowd and people who might have tried something similar.

86 inches gives me a couple inches of clearance. I was originally going to pick something up similar to a 3x3 Collegiate Power Rack, but its about 8 inches too tall.

Any suggestions would be fantastic. Thank you!",powerlifting,Looking for suggestions for power racks below 86 inches that have drop bars

1594278713,"I normally try to put more detail into these, but I'm exhausted and going back into lockdown sucks.

Meet got moved forward three days with 24 hours notice, but the idea was mine, so that's my own fault. 

I'm about 5-6kg lighter than last meet in december, but the weigh-in was at 4pm, so I ate all day to not die. Weighed in at 131.9kg

Comp was running fast and nobody was really warming up on top, which pushed my last squat warmup to be like 3 minutes before my opener.

**Squats**

I forgot how to squat. Felt weird for all of my warmups and nobody could tell me what was up.

**Opener 261kg  SUCCESS**

**Second 270kg  (-12kg comp PR) SUCCESS**

[https://www.instagram.com/p/CCYYUBmjuzt/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCYYUBmjuzt/)

**Third CAN'T FAIL IF YOU DON'T TRY**

I didn't take a third because I just didn't care to try hard because I felt exhausted.

Honestly, I think I'm stronger than ever before, but I just forgot how to lift. Did missing 3 days of the taper have this much of an impact or am I just losing my mind? why not both

**Bench**

Praise be that bench exists. I'm tempted to pretend this comp was bench only because it's the only thing that didn't suck.

**Opener 175kg - SUCCESS**

Self un-racked and that was an adventure. I felt that I dumped it on my chest a bit, but it went fast.

**Second attempt 185kg - SUCCESS**

I got a lift off because my left shoulder was not liking it. Was fast I was told.  (7kg comp PR)

**Third attempt 191kg - SUCCESS**

13kg comp PR [https://www.instagram.com/p/CCYW4cbj5XM/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCYW4cbj5XM/)

I went conservative because training had been crazy good, but my pecs tightened up on a bad slingshot set and my shoulders got wonky. I have some residual median nerve numbness, which kind of sucks. Real happy to have a sizeable bench PR after all the work I've put in for so long.

1594239224,"I'm [21M, 64.8kg] a climber and I decided to use powerlifting as a means to improve my power to weight ratio. Twelve days ago I stuggled to pull 70kg for 5x3 in my very first session. Yesterday I wanted to push myself (3rd session) so I did some warmup pulls for form and continued to increase weight. Yesterday's lifts looked something like this (rounded from freedom units):

65x3 (easyish)
70.3x3 (medium)
79.4x3 (hard)
88.4x3 (very hard)
88.4x3 (very hard, form suffered on 3rd pull)
79.4x3 (very hard)

Between yesterday's session and the previous session (72 hours rest) I saw a 20kg difference in what I would describe as ""very hard,"" ~80-90% 1RM. I plan on lifting and climbing again tomorrow (36-40hrs rest) with the target weight being 93kg, but I don't know how to optimize my 5-6x3 so that there aren't large increments as I try to guess at what the new ""very hard"" will be.

Given that form faltered after the 6th rep, I also don't know if I should shed a few kilos at the top for a more consistent pulling session, or rather how much to shed, OR if I should expect to feel more comfortable pulling that weight and expect another jump of 5-10kg. 

TL;DR: Form and strength are improving rapidly, how do I plan my session ahead of time for large beginner incremental increases?",powerlifting,How to structure deadlift sets as form and strength rapidly improve?

1593800813,"Some quick background on myself: competitive powerlifter in highschool and college (now just as a hobby) and current Highland games athlete in A class. 
I was also an assistant S&amp;C for two years at the D1 level prior to going to PT school. Upon graduation I was a staff PT for a D1 athletics program. 
I picked up this program because I absolutely love BB medicine and their content. However, this program, in my opinion was a massive swing and a miss. All my critiques and criticism are based on how I like to train and the methods that work best for me. This is not at all meant to be taken as a broad generalization for all lifters/competitors. 
Weaknesses:
Lots of volume with little to no variation from phase to phase. You maintain the exact same set/reps scheme for months. This drives me crazy and I get bored quickly and lose motivation (my favorite program is 5/3/1 with my own little additions). 
You squat EVERY training session which always leaves me completely depleted for deadlifts. The big three all have a top single at 92-95% and then 4-5 back down sets. My body just can’t take that heavy workload 4x/week. 
You also bench every training session with the same set/rep scheme (starting heavy ass single with a tons of back down sets) which led to  a pec tear. 
I lost 30 lbs on my deadlift with this program which was the main impetus to quit the program early. 
It seemed like a more random and haphazard version of Juggernaut training powerlifting program. 

Pros: I love the BB medicine guys and gals so I understand that this program may be great for some but was terrible for me.",powerlifting,Barbell Medicine Powerlifting II Review

1593667901,,powerlifting,Thoughts on this bench program?
1593662456," I'm  an older guy with immobile  shoulders. To make it a short story, I want  to use a typical wide grip  (I was going even wider onto the sleeve) but  it's very awkward because  the hooks are right where the hands are on a  standard power rack. Are  there any standard practices or tips you have  to secure the weight and  not smash the fingers? I still can't grip next  to my shoulders like  when I was younger.

Surprisingly haven't found anything yet by searching, only seeing some bigger guys do it.",powerlifting,Unracking and Racking Squats With a Wide Grip

1593657540," Hey, thanks for reading.

Straight into it:

* 21yo
* Been lifting on/off for 3 years (1.5/2 years with decent form)
* I haven't ever successfully bulked past the first few months I started lifting (or counted calories for longer than a week at a time)
* Bodyweight fluctuating between 65-70kg (145-155lbs) at around 171cm (5'7in) \*Started at approx 57kg (125lbs)
* Never been consistent with a program but mainly did PPL

Here are my max lifts at 68-70kg (150-155lbs):

Bench:

* 102.5kg (226lbs) x 1 **TNG**
* 90kg (\~200lbs) x 4 **TNG**

Squat:

* 140kg (308lbs) x 2 (average form, parallel to the ground)

Deadlift:

* 180kg (396lbs) x 1

My goal is not necessary powerlifting, I just want to get stronger. It just so happens that these lifts are predominantly the same lifts that make you look and feel strong. I've got a firm and solid understanding of exercise science, but my biggest let down is arguably my nutrition - which I'm studying and hammering down on now.

I would appreciate any advice on how to move forward from here. I do believe that if I can get my nutrition, sleep, and programming on point - I would hit numbers I wouldn't ever think I could. I can run virtually any program because I own a home-gym.

Thank you.",powerlifting,Am I still considered a novice? Would appreciate some insight because I'm trying to find/build a suitable program.

1592887373,"Hi guys, just looking for some advice from anyone that has any experience with this. 

I’ve been powerlifting for over a year now and I’ve have consistent stomach pain once I started dead lifting over 200lbs. 

I use a lifting belt and it definitely exacerbates the issue but I like using it and I also feel safer/more comfortable with it as I’ve had some back issues in my pass. I work on core strength consistently though to make sure it is keeping up with the rest of my body. I’ve recently gotten a more malleable belt, which helped a bit but not significantly.

I’d describe the pain as just intense painful pressure in my stomach that goes up into my esophagus (I hate myself for this description but it’s the best I can think of 😂). No nausea or anything, it is only during the lift and does not continue after. 

I’ve recently starting putting my belt on quickly and doing my dead lifts very fast and this has definitely helped quite a bit.

I’ve stopped eating 1.5-3 hours beforehand (experimenting which works best) and also trying different foods (no dairy/only smoothies/plainer food such as oatmeal) but nothing has made a difference. I also find it difficult to have a successful workout if I’ve eaten more than 1.5 hours before the workout as I don’t end up feeling fuelled. 

Sorry this is long, but it’s been a consistent frustration for me. I’ve deadlifted less and cut reps when I do, and obviously this makes for way less progress. I’ve subbed in more assist work to help but it’s not the same. Any help or advice would be so appreciated!

1592770718,"I know this comes off as a vague question, but I've heard people talk about powerlifters, specifically coaches, as ""knowledgeable"" vs not knowing what they're doing. Sure, you have formally educated individuals like Dr. Mike Israetel or Dr. Layne Norton, but what about high-level athletes/coaches like Jonnie Candito or Joseph Franzo? I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure neither of them have degrees in exercise science/kinesiology, for all that that's worth. As an intermediate powerlifter, how can I achieve this? Obviously competition experience is huge (I've only done 1 meet, powerlifting for ~1 year). Do I just do a lot of research online, compete more, and over the years accumulate knowledge? I guess my ultimate goal is to learn how to coach others and self-program, similar to what Candito does now.",powerlifting,"How does one become ""knowledgeable"" in powerlifting?"

1592762075,"So ive tried a few programs including SL 5x5 and nsuns... honestly liked them but I got very tired of doing very repetitive medium load and very high volume. Also im no way an advanced lifter, (150lbs 5’9 19yrs, 205lbs bench, 245lbs squat, and 280lbs dead) Ive always been a skinny fat body type and ate less than I needed. Now ive been eating 2800-3000 cals a day and im gaining very decently, but I still believe im somewhat thin and I want to maximize the intensity to try and gain that thick bone structure. Though, Body dysmorphia or not, I love training with very heavy weights (1-3 reps) and im trying to create a benching and squatting program (I think my deadlift still has lots of workout to workout LP left) which would resemble the Bulgarian method with the high intensity every session but tweaked to fit my athletic level.

I was thinking something along the lines of a couple warmup sets to a set of five then a triple then working up to training max with a couple singles. (1x5 1x3 1x1 1x1) though im coming to reddit because i want to know if someones had any experience with something similar to this. Any advice or pointers to programs would be absolutely awesome. Thanks for your time.

I\`ve been lfting on and off for 7 years now, Oly. (coached) for about 3 years. Am a bit sick and tired of always haveing little ""ouchies"" and people telling me i look like i don\`t lift. 

Jokes aside, how would you qualify the the strain on your body in a decently cycled powerlifting program?

During quarantine, I've been able to do goblet squats with up to 60lbs, and I've bern doing a lot of cycling for legs and cardio 2 times a week. For chest I've mostly done push ups and banded flies.

I was prepared for a loss of strength when the gym reopened last week, but am still surprised how much I lost squat strength compared to bench strength.

First day back in the gym I benched and squatted 135lbs for 4 sets of 3 no problem, but my legs were EXTREMELY sore for several days after. next chest day i was able to do 155lbs for 5 sets of 3 on bench easily, but on the next leg day I barely managed 135lbs for 5x3.

I have only been powerlifting training for about 3-4 weeks after gyms opened and I decided to follow the candito linear program. A friend introduced me to the program and his YouTube channel and I loved his content so decided to follow his free program

After weeks into the program, the lower body days are starting to be a bit tough since I'm squatting and deadlifting in the same session and I can't help but feel my deadlifts are suffering a little e.g my hips and legs are already quite tired after squats and I have to hit deadlifts straight after (conventional deadlifts and high bar squats). My CNS also feels fried by the end of the workout, whereas upper body feels good and I don't feel devastated after the workout.

Anyone else who runs or has run this program can give me some advice and insight? I know I haven't been doing this program for long and will stick it out but looking for any help to get stronger.

Inspired by /u/oakleypowerlifting's post showing the [distribution of men's max bench press](https://old.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/gvxnp0/distribution_of_each_mans_max_raw_benchpress_all/) I decided to make similar charts for all lifts and totals for both men and women.

Hey, so my main issue is when I sumo(or any) deadlift at certain weight, I have to either use straps or use chalk with alternating grip. The issue is:

1. I cant use hook grip due to really small hand/ failed to learn it before
2. I dont normally train with alternating because it worsens my hip imbalance, and only do so a month out from meet
3. I use normal loop strap and when setting up I like to descend while opening my legs to position and leaning forward to to wrap the strap down several times makes me lose form, and theres a huge difference in my form, hip and body pivot if I go into it from standing vs from being hunched over the bar after wrapping the straps
4. its a cheap bar I got during the pandemic so the knurling is pretty meh compared to an Ohio or texas bar I used to use

So I was wondering whats some straps that might be easier to setup and faster so I dont lose my form? I.E I saw some people use straps with metal hooks that I can just hook on or figure 8 straps seem a bit easier and faster, but any input is appreciated.",powerlifting,Grip and fastest types of straps options

I  just had my 6 week post op appointment from a serious surgery where my  appendix burst, an abscess formed and I had to have about 6"" of colon  removed due to the infection.

I  will be easing back into lifting over the course of several months (  Previous PR's S-405 D-495 B-315), and focusing on my core strength and  stability before restarting any sort of program. However, my surgeon  told me that I have to give up lifting heavy completely, and no  deadlifts for the rest of my life due to risk of hernia at the incision  site.

Has anyone ever returned to  powerlifting, specifically deadlifting, after a similar abdominal  surgery?

Two weeks ago started going back to the gym, managed to bring my numbers back running Phrak's GSLP to 265/230/340. I'm 6ft, 176lb, 15% bf. So my goal is still a 1000lb total, however also to cut to 10%.

I know cutting and gaining strength is going to be hard, so willing to eat at maintenance, providing this could work. Just not sure what to do to reach this goal.

Certainly there are a lot of factors that can determine your ability to progress such as past injuries.

I've mostly just been working the standard bench, squat and deadlift as I'm still early into getting back into lifting. Obviously you should be able to do at least bodyweight for these lifts, but is 125% good for bench and maybe 200% for squat?

1590609684,"So I don't have a specific literature reference for this, it is more of a question from semi-consistent reading of running/lifting. I know in marathon running (or any race above 5k), it is common for athletes to spend a period of time building a large aerobic base of miles before getting into race specific training (for 12-16 weeks). I am wondering if there is some possibility of a cross application to powerlifting for the beginner/new intermediate.  

I currently bench 190 lbs for a 5x5 at 135 lbs of weight as a 5' 4"" male. I have done 5x5 for a while, on and off for a couple years, and consistently for 3ish months. Of course, there is no reason to abandon the program if I am consistently seeing improvement workout to workout or even week to week, but this is somewhat of a curiosity question. 

I am planning on maxing in late June. Would it be beneficial to start moving to 3x5, 3x3, 1x5 etc in the last month and keep adding 5 lbs (if I cannot complete 5x5) each workout? I would be increasing the load and only training my body for a 1RM. This would probably result in less progress on a long term basis, but I am wondering for a one month phase. Once I have a 1RM, I would then ""return"" to my aerobic phase analog of lifting, and back solve a 5RM calculator to get my 5x5 weight. I would then do the standard 5x5 workout for 5 months, and in the 6th month, re-do my 3x5, 3x3 decline down etc, get a new 1RM, and cycle on for a bit.

AFTER | 6'3""| 214 | 425 | 325 | 525

**BACKGROUND / LIFTING HISTORY:**

My all-time best gym lifts are somewhere around 445/320/545, but I have not been anywhere close to those numbers for a couple of years now. I have been spinning my wheels due to injuries (lower back and right IT band). I've tried quite a few different programs and I've pretty much just been treading water for a long time. The 'BEFORE' numbers listed above a pretty close to where I've been sitting - possibly even a little optimistic. I ran this program with the hopes of competing again on May 23rd but since the meet was canceled I decided to do a mock meet at home instead.

**PROGRAM REVIEW:**

The program is broken up into four blocks. Each block is 3-4 weeks long, with 4 training sessions a week. I actually ran the first block twice due to timing (I was supposed to have a meet May 23rd but it was canceled due to the 'rona). I'm glad I ran it twice because the first time through allowed me to get used to the bench volume. I upped my training maxes a bit after that first block before starting the program in earnest.

The first block has you doing some variation of bench press every session. You're squatting or doing a variant 3 times a week, deadlift or a variant 2 times a week. You're also doing some sort of upper back accessory every training session which seemed to compliment the bench frequency and had some carryover to my deadlift. Most of the variations were very close to the core movements so they had a lot of carryover. The paused deadlifts really seemed to help lock in my starting position and build strength off the floor. Similarly, the pin squats helped develop strength out of the hole and reduce my dependency on the stretch reflex.

The second block increased intensity and backed off the volume just a bit. It was common to work up to some heavy top sets and then do some back-off work. This was new to me but I really liked it. I'm used to just working up to my heavy working sets and then being done, but this allowed me to get some more volume in without burning out. The structure of this block was very similar to the first. Paused squats were substituted in for pin squats which I really enjoyed.

The third month was sort of a transition phase where the intensity and specificity really kicked up. There was more RPE work for some of the accessories which was new to me. I could definitely tell that my lifts were progressing during this phase.


The fourth block was a lot of RPE work. I had never trained using RPE so it took a little bit of learning but I feel like I quickly got the hang of it. This is the peaking block and I could really see my lifts progressing as the weeks went on. Using RPE I found that I was able to push myself pretty often. I think I only had one day where I felt like I needed to lower my weight because I was feeling off.

The taper week went really smoothly. I appreciated that the taper was very short. I still went into my mock meet feeling strong and well-rested.




**THINGS I LIKED:**

The mixture of volume/intensity/frequency really _clicked_ with me. I was able to make great progress on all of my lifts without re-injuring myself (or really ever even feeling close).

The bench frequency made my bench press absolutely explode. I had only ever benched 315 or 320 three times in my life and those were all touch and go. In my mock meet I was able to bench 325 with a good pause pretty easily.

The back-off sets were a game-changer for me. They allowed me to get more quality reps in without overtaxing my body.

I was able to hit every single rep of every single set of every single training session. Each session was taxing but didn't leave me overly drained. I felt like I was building strength without beating myself up. Throughout the program I just marveled at how great every workout felt. It increased my confidence regarding my lingering injuries and it made me excited to get into the gym every day.

The specificity of the training really helped me dial in my form. Getting so many quality reps on each lift was extremely valuable.

**THINGS I DISLIKED:**

There is virtually no arm work. That isn't a huge knock on the program since I could easily add it somewhere and the program is only built for powerlifting.

The core work (mostly the planks) was pretty boring and I'm not sure how much carryover it had. When I run the program again I'll probably swap that out for different core exercises.

**CONCLUSION:**

I would 100% recommend this program to anyone, particularly people in the higher-intermediate/low-advanced powerlifting levels. I am planning on running this program again and I'm confident that I will easily crack the 1300 total barrier (don't laugh - that's good for me!).

I actually ran the first block twice due to timing (I was supposed to have a meet May 23rd but it was canceled due to the 'rona). I'm glad I ran it twice because the first time through allowed me to get used to the bench volume. I upped my training maxes a bit after that first block before starting the program in earnest.

The first block has you doing some variation of bench press every session. You're squatting or doing a variant 3 times a week, deadlift or a variant 2 times a week. You're also doing some sort of upper back accessory every training session which seemed to compliment the bench frequency and had some carryover to my deadlift. Most of the variations were very close to the core movements so they had a lot of carryover. The paused deadlifts really seemed to help lock in my starting position and build strength off the floor. Similarly, the pin squats helped develop strength out of the hole and reduce my dependency on the stretch reflex.

The second block increased intensity and backed off the volume just a bit. It was common to work up to some heavy top sets and then do some back-off work. This was new to me but I really liked it. I'm used to just working up to my heavy working sets and then being done, but this allowed me to get some more volume in without burning out. The structure of this block was very similar to the first. Paused squats were substituted in for pin squats which I really enjoyed.

The third month was sort of a transition phase where the intensity and specificity really kicked up. There was more RPE work for some of the accessories which was new to me. I could definitely tell that my lifts were progressing during this phase.


The fourth block was a lot of RPE work. I had never trained using RPE so it took a little bit of learning but I feel like I quickly got the hang of it. This is the peaking block and I could really see my lifts progressing as the weeks went on. Using RPE I found that I was able to push myself pretty often. I think I only had one day where I felt like I needed to lower my weight because I was feeling off.

The taper week went really smoothly. I appreciated that the taper was very short. I still went into my mock meet feeling strong and well-rested.




**THINGS I LIKED:**

The mixture of volume/intensity/frequency really _clicked_ with me. I was able to make great progress on all of my lifts without re-injuring myself (or really ever even feeling close).

The bench frequency made my bench press absolutely explode. I had only ever benched 315 or 320 three times in my life and those were all touch and go. In my mock meet I was able to bench 325 with a good pause pretty easily.

The back-off sets were a game-changer for me. They allowed me to get more quality reps in without overtaxing my body.

I was able to hit every single rep of every single set of every single training session. Each session was taxing but didn't leave me overly drained. I felt like I was building strength without beating myself up. Throughout the program I just marveled at how great every workout felt. It increased my confidence regarding my lingering injuries and it made me excited to get into the gym every day.

The specificity of the training really helped me dial in my form. Getting so many quality reps on each lift was extremely valuable.

**THINGS I DISLIKED:**

There is virtually no arm work. That isn't a huge knock on the program since I could easily add it somewhere and the program is only built for powerlifting.

The core work (mostly the planks) was pretty boring and I'm not sure how much carryover it had. When I run the program again I'll probably swap that out for different core exercises.

**CONCLUSION:**

I would 100% recommend this program to anyone, particularly people in the higher-intermediate/low-advanced powerlifting levels. I am planning on running this program again and I'm confident that I will easily crack the 1300 total barrier (don't laugh - that's good for me!).

1590153787," Hello everyone,

I'm  169cm/5'6.5'', previously I was 78\~80Kg, most of my body fats were in  my belly fat. So I made a diet and got down to 48\~50Kg. As you can see  became an underweight while being so physically weak.

Since  the quarantine days, I started to read and been interested so much into  powerlifting, so I bought a barbell, dumbell and couple of weights and  started StrongLifts 5x5 routine. My current numbers are as you may have  expected too light, my squats are 15Kg (5Kg barbell weight + 2x5Kg free  weights).

My question is, I want  to get as strong and big as soon as I can in a healthy way, from the 4th  session I plateaued, so I tried to increase the volume, and also  thinking to increase additional exercises to the routine like some  curls, isolation exercises, and such with the goal to add intensity to  my workout.

I'm looking to add  intensity so that when I increase my food intake, it doesn't get stored  as fat and hopefully most go to muscle mass instead (I'm aware that a  portion of the excess calories must be stored as fats, I'm trying to  minimalize as possible the fats since I still have belly fat even being  skinny underweight).

So any  recommendations on the type of exercises to add to my routine in order  to increase the intensity of the workout and strength, and hopefully  help defeating my current plateau state.

1590097811,"Hi! first time poster. I believe currently many of us are building a setup at home to continue lifting, and I think this post can benefit us all (which is why I'm posting it here, I hope it's the right place)

I've been designing multiple ways of lifting platform to find the most noise and vibration lessening one. My neighbours' living room is next to my garage so it's kind of a necessity. 

**Question starts here:**

After watching Hafthor's 501kg deadlift, I was surprised how quiet it was and how little did the weights bounced, even though they were iron plates. So I investigated a bit and found out they are Rogue's 40mm (\~1.5"") high density rubber flooring. Importing them isn't an option for me, but I've found ""double density"" (I guess that's equivalent) 20mm (\~3/4"") ones. Would stacking two of them have a similar effect? What if I glue/screw them? I was thinking of bolting them down to the platform anyways, but I guess the strength transfer between the two (and therefore the force mitigation) would be better if they were glued together. What kind of glue should I use?

Anyone has tried this, how did it go?

**TL;DR:**

Would stacking two 20mm high-density rubber mats achieve the same effect as Rogue's 40mm high-density rubber mats for a lifting platform? Any other tips?",powerlifting,Garage Gym Platform Building advice

I currently do a 5x5 Bench Press as part of a PPL split. Because I run, I only do one leg day per week, and substitute the second as a rest day. I currently bench press 190 lbs for 5x5. I have noticed that alot of posts on this sub tend to move away from 5x5 at around this BW ratio, but am unsure if I should use overall weight or BW ratio as my guide.

I have not stalled 3 times in a row on bench press yet, nor have I done a deload week (aside from the past month as quarantine). While the 5x5 is not broken, if I only care about increasing overall max bench press, should I switch to 3x5 or an intermediate program?

1589279365,"Hi all,

I have recently tried switching over to sumo and have found reps very easy - I only have 190kg of weight and am on a second floor of an old house so have to lower the bar super slowly. With that, i can only do high reps - my max conventional ever was around 240kg (pre-rona i had a lot of time off deadlifts as I was doing Oly lifting practice so my conventional max is more like 210/220 atm).

I'm not sure if I have gotten significantly stronger, or sumo just tends to be this way: my first rep is often quite slow (only my 3rd week sumo deadlifting so might be a form/confidence issue?) but i can still crank out 10 reps, with the same speed of the first rep but on conventional it would be about 5 reps. 

Is sumo just much easier for reps? Should i use different metrics to calculate my max? I'm not built well for deadlifts, in fact i have almost perfectly average leverages for everything, the most average limb to torso lengths and 6'0/182cm tall, so my range of motion is still fairly large.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks",powerlifting,Sumo Reps Vs Max

1589268889,"I know this is a powerlifting sub, and that is the sport I'm into, though I'm interested in strongman as well. But many of us don't have a home gym, me included. Depression and lack of eating became a prominent part of my recent lifestyle. Perhaps many of you guys can relate. The feeling of heavy lifting and progression is an addiction that is so difficult to replicate in other areas of life.
But, I just got a keg, found it online for 20 dollars, and filled it with some sand, and it's really turning my lockdown life and mood around. 
Keg overhead press, squats, and I'm planning to get some chains from home depot and some metal pipes to create a keg weighted dip station. 
The fact I can create progression by filling with sand, and the fact that sand is so cheap, is a lifesaver.
To those that are broke as hell, I urge you to find a keg! 
My goal is to be able to do a clean and press of 225 pounds within the next three months, while maintaining my muscle with high volume keg squats and heavy keg dips. Even 100 pounds was difficult for a keg press my first time however, so we shall see how it works out.

1589024616,"In my first competition as a powerlifter, I was forced, together with the rest of the contenders, all experienced and strong (physically and mentally) than me , to wait more than 6 hours between each of the lifting exercises in which we competed. Anyone who watches sports competitions knows that this is more or less a two-three-hour event. We waited 6 hours between the Bench Press and the Deadlift. 6 long exhausting hours in which much of the tension of the first entrance has already been removed, but we must save more for the second exercise. And meanwhile, stressed, bored, irritated, tired and hungry –  because we got up early and at least some of us can’t perform well on a full stomach – and then another dry fruits and another energy drink, but 6 hours!!!

Finally, 6 hours later, then the announcer announces that we have 10 minutes to warm up and then, the last round of the competition  begins, and everyone, like a well-oiled machine, concentrates all energies and BOOM!!! We did our part and lift the barbells.

Because in training we practiced the long breaks – the official explanation is that you need recovery time between sets – but if you ask me, 6 hours do not contribute to recovery. Vice versa. But on the other hand, the long wait causes the body to know, at the moment of truth, without complex preparation, exactly what and how it should be done.

Each of the base exercises in powerlifting, long before it is a strength exercise, is a neural exercise. And when the nervous system knows what is expected of it, it mobilizes in a fraction of a second.

When the organization finds out that it is in the middle of a cyber attack, every second counts. Any decision will immediately affect the situation. The most fundamental dilemma, whether to paralyze server and backup, will be simple if the reasons and implications are clear. The question of whether to comply with the hacker’s infidel demand would be different if it was considered during a calm routine, as opposed to the urgency of making the decision under fire.

Business Resilience, Cyber Resilience, depends entirely on the ability to make good  decisions under fire. Equifax managers decided to sell shares as soon as the data breach was announced – two hours within the event and the share plunged by more than 30%. The managers are currently under federal investigation, the Senate is pressuring the new management, and the public is suing in small claims court for $ 10,000 each, as the American law allows it as a victim of an information leakage. The damage is huge and its ramifications are wide and consistent.

Decision making under fire dictates the business resilience of the organization to cope and recover quickly and efficiently. If it is important for you to lead your organization effectively within a cyber attack, there are three critical questions that you, as CEO, must ask yourself:

* What do you know about the threat that could endanger your organization ? Do you understand what your security manager is talking about if and when you ever talk to him?

* The human factor is responsible for 95% of cyber attacks – what do you do about it ? Do you feel confident that ayear ago you heard a lecture about awareness?

You can’t rely on that time when you had an awareness talk. Awareness is not a campaign that you approve once a year and it’s definitely not a phishing email sent on Wednesday because it all worked out that way. Awareness is a daily routine. Awareness is a breathing process that changes all the time cus of employees change, in and out and moving on. The sophistication of attacks will always be upgraded. Access roads will always be challenged. You must lead an active approach that will practice the organization all the time, even without feeling challenged. You must be interested in the results of these tests, to reflect them to members of management, to the Board of Directors.

* Who do you call as soon as you discover that you are in the middle of an event? Do you have a response team that know how to act together and familiar with your business needs?

It’s possible to perform successfully, after long 6 hours, only when you practice the body to do what is accepted from him in real time.  Maintaining business resilience during a cyber attack is your ability to immediately concentrate all relevant factors – technological, legal,  financial, marketing, human resources – and get them to unite in one second and work as a skilled team.

Legendary boxer Mike Tyson has said in the past that everyone has a plan, until he gets a punch in the face. Really, everyone has?

I'm in quarantine and want to make some massive gains. I also have a poverty bench so I was thinking hey why don't I do smolov but for bench instead of squat (plus my squat is really good - better than my deadlift sometimes). I read up on that and learned that smolov is only suggested for the squat since it will lead to elbow/shoulder pain and many imbalances. Instead they recommend smolov jr. which is only 3 weeks + a week of testing which I guess I'm not as hyped about. I want a little bit of a longer program than smolov jr. but also something intense and something I will make some nice gains with. Any suggestions? Multiple smolov jr blocks? Just go for the true smolov bench program and see what happens? Another similar program?

1588633772,"Hi everyone!

I come to you to see if you can help me solve a problem I've been struggling with since 1 year maybe. It's simple, everytime I squat and deadlift, I start feeling a type of soreness in my lower back.

I don't particurarly lift heavy, I'm a little guy and I just lift 80 kg, and I'm very careful with the tecnhique (I really focus on not corving my lower back and keep it thigh and not relaxed) but as I keep doing more and more sets the pain keeps increasing.

At the first set of the squats I practically don't feel nothing, the second one I can feel some sensation there, but in the third and fourth set the soreness really starts to be noticeable.

My main concern is to develop a herniated disc, I really care for my health and I'm very young (19 years) and I don't want to fuck up my back for the rest of my life. 

2 years ago the doctors did me a MRI and noticed a lumbar protusion, because I used to suffer lower back pain when walking for a long period of time (which I keep suffering btw). The traumathologiat recommended me to just do exercises with the back laying on something, advise that I sent to hell since I think that's bullshit.

In terms of stretching, I just do a common stretch at the beginning of the set, 3 min before, and I think I should stretch longer but idk, I want to hear your opinions.

One last thing, the pain get worse if I didn't exercise for a long period of time, for example, if I didn't workout for 1 month, the next time I squat I will feel a much more intense pain. On the other hand, if I've been exercising for 3 months straight I will keep feeling the pain but less intense.",powerlifting,Problem with squats and deadlifts

1588279223,"Since the sub has been dead, thought I would share the meet report of the last meet before the Corona hit the wold.

**Meet results**  [https://www.openpowerlifting.org/m/xpc/2001](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/m/xpc/2001)  [https://www.xpcpowerlifting.com/2020-xpc-finals-results/](https://www.xpcpowerlifting.com/2020-xpc-finals-results/) 

**About me**

I'm an aging powerlifter trying to compete with guys 8-20 years younger then me. Body is starting to break down (tendons) so meets are becoming more spread apart. Have competed from 165-198 class. I was recovering from some injuries so I know my total wouldn't be high enough to directly compete with Anthoy  Hobaica, and would have to do something crazy to stand a chance against Carole FnBaskins.... I mean, Larry wheels, so decided to make the cut down under 165, its been a long time since I've competed at that weight.

**Meet Training**

My training sucked to describe it, injuries weren't healing fast enough to get my total up, shoulder was bugging me, so I had to limit my volume, hip was hurting so slowed my deadlift and squat, plus I kept getting horrible painful episodes of prednisone hiccups that would last over 24 hours straight keeping me up all night that would effect some important training sessions. I stopped my prednisone a week before the meet hoping they would not flair up before meet day (refeed/rehydrate day), and it seemed to not hit me then thankfully. I ended up tearing my oblique 5 weeks before the meet, which it healed in time, but really impacted my deadlift training. Some would think that my water cut affected my platform results, but it was my piss-poor training.

**Prep**

Made my weight cut and put back on the weight, and thankfully no hiccups so i was able to sleep enough the night before.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Meet.**  [**https://youtu.be/jWbxkq1GML4**](https://youtu.be/jWbxkq1GML4)

This was raw with wraps for me. I didn't have a handler, since the Arnold was strict in who could come with the pre-corona lock down. I wrap my own knees but typically need someone to help call my depth as I start to black out a the bottom and have no feeling when I get close. One guy that goes to my gym sometimes tried to help but he said he wasn't good at it.

**Squats** [**https://youtu.be/0GLoJXKSRso**](https://youtu.be/0GLoJXKSRso)

I opened with 665, got it easy enough but with 2 whites, one red.

Second attempt added 50 to go 715 for a pr and what I was after, choked on it.

Third attempt I tried to speed up the descent, and I managed to barely get it up, but got redlights as I didn't go deep enough.

**Bench** [**https://youtu.be/SH6MK9LgssA**](https://youtu.be/SH6MK9LgssA)

Opened at 455, it was slow but got it no problem, but they gave me redlights as they said I heaved it.

So for the second I retook the 455 and went down real slow controlling it completely on the way down and up. All whites.

Third I thought I'd see if I could get a 3X raw bench so tried 475, tried to go faster down and pop it up quick after the pause, but I stalled and the spotter grabbed it, don't think I had it anyways.

**Deadlifts** [**https://youtu.be/n0Yh01VpeB0**](https://youtu.be/n0Yh01VpeB0)

With tearing my oblique 5 weeks prior, wasn't sure how I would do, I decided to change my opener from 620 to 635 to get me at least the #2 165 spot. Warmups I could feel I was still weak.

First attemped got the 635, but they tried to make me hold it for a while and my grip was coming undone, so I put it down fast, a hair before the down command, so all reds.

Second I taped my thumb a little better (use hook grip as a tore my left biceps before) and the 635 went up slow but was able to hold it long enough for the down command.

Third I could tell taking that 635 twice took it out of me, so I didn't think I had much left at all, a training partner came up and noticed it and said I should only try 655, I told him I thought that was to much for where I was at and decided to see if 645 had anything, which it didn't really budge the floor.

**Aftermath** [**https://youtu.be/jWbxkq1GML4**](https://youtu.be/jWbxkq1GML4)

So I only really got my openers 1755 total. Anthony ended up tearing his biceps on his second pull, but still hit a 1900lb total, Larry ended up beating Lillabridges record by .1lbs or something, so I finished behind Larry on coefficient for best raw lifter. Was able to at least get the #2 spot for the 165.",powerlifting,"[Meet Report] 3/7/2020 Arnold XPC Finals. Columbus, Ohio. |M41|796kg/1775lbs @71.6kg/158lbs| 585.9 Wilks"

1588204440,"TL;DR: Do you think the Transformer bar is worth it?

Discussion: 

I am going to buy a ssb this week, and I was dead set on getting the Black Widow until I found the Kabuki Transformer. 

A primary reason why I like the Black Widow compared to other versions like the Titan, Elite, Rogue, etc., is because I like the longer handles. I also just like Black Widow gear.

However, I like the Transformer better than the Black Widow because the section of the bar that goes through the shoulder pads is curved, so it looks like it fits over the shoulder nicely (I've only also noticed this curve with the Power Lift ssb, which very pricy at $600-$900 for just the plain ssb). In addition, I can't do back squats because of my shoulders, and I can't do front squats with the traditional form because of my wrists. I figure if I shell out some extra cash, I can have an awesome yoke like I wanted, but I also get to train back squats, front squats, and cambered squats. 

Before I found the Kabuki bar, I was planning on getting the Black Widow front squat bar and a spider bar further down the line.

I'll add that while my goals are not to compete in powerlifting, lifting weights is pretty much the most important thing in my life hands down. I'm building my home gym to be a strength/power set up... my focus is on powerlifting and strongman. 

So any of you who have used this bar, do you think the cost of the bar with all its variations are worth it over a traditional SSB? How do the back squat, front squat, and cambered bar settings feel on the Transformer?",powerlifting,Kabuki Strength Transformer V3—is it worth it?

1587927464," Hello all,

I am an old user here but mostly to read and learn, occasionally post some things but never felt I really had the knowledge or experience to contribute. However I had a really good experience now with Mr. Buffett and thought I would share.

**Background:**

Still havent competed but been training focusing on the big three for like five years. On 2019 hired my first coach but had to part ways due to some personal reasons. However I liked the experience and ended up reaching to [Antjuan](https://www.instagram.com/tweezy2eezy/) [/u/tweezy2eezy](https://www.reddit.com/u/tweezy2eezy/) and we started working together on January 2020.

Lifts starting were 340/265/440

**1st Contact:**

Reached out to him on his coaching page [Buffbarbell](https://www.instagram.com/buffbarbell/) and after some talk he send me a questionnaire to evaluete if we were a good fit. Questionnaire had questions about training age, outside stressors, equipments available, what have worked on the past (in terms of frequency for each lift, style of programming, etc), injuries, other limitations like time constraints and a few others, I guess standard information a coach would need to write a decent program.

From my side, my biggest wish/demand was a good communication, which he totally agreed it was important and said he demanded it too. We would use Whatsapp to communicate, he said I could message him anytime and he would do his best to answer in just a few hours. Traning videos should be sent after every workout via Whatsapp and he would give feedback straight away.

Programming would be sent weekly on Sundays/Mondays.

**First two months:**

Programming was very different from what I was doing. I was doing more sheiko style with submaximal stuff, his programming felt way harder and took me some time to adapt. We worked alot on my form on squats and sumo deadlift, made several changes which at first felt awkward but with the time proved to be very promising.

As promised, communication was vas very intense and he took his time to explain to me everything we were doing programmingwise and also the changes and cues for my lifts, including vários audios and recorded videos just to show me stuff.

**Last three months/Results**

Done with first adjustments but we keep reinforcing them and working hard. Rep range started to decrease and things started getting more enjoyable lol. 

*Squat Results*:

Was having hip issues when we started and through stance changes and really focusing on rooting and some other minor things hit a [385lb squa](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_N99LIAxaR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)t with is a 35lb PR. I was very happy to hit this painless. (Link)

*Bench Results*:

Bench went really well too, focus were keeping tension when pausing and bar path, and[I hit 285lb which is a 20 PR](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_Sw-gjgOsr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

*Deadlift results*:

Focus from the beginning were learning to anchor my body properly against the bar and with it trying to pop the bar from the ground. Feel like deadlift in terms of programming was the biggest difference and it paid of big time. [Was able to hit 500lb which is a 60lb PR.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_adVEwA3hl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

**Final thoughts**

Huge progress for just 16 weeks working with Antjuan, [putting 115lb oh my total.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_a9NxRABz9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Goes without saying that we'll keep going and I'll do a meet in October (if it doesn't get canceled).

I'm just so damn satisfied with his coaching. We have a 7 hour time difference and he manages to keep constant contact with me, always checking in and sending me stuff like videos out of the blue from cues or stretches he thinks could help me. He puts alot of effort in his coaching and his athlete's success, I really didn't expect such good commitment and was impressed with it.

**TLDR**

[115lb increase in my total in 16 weeks](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_a9NxRABz9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) . Fucking great communication and commitment. Very much satisfied.

1587756272,"Hey, I've recently been looking into ways of combining strength training (specifically powerlifting) with running (not particularly long distances like marathons, more like 2-5 km).

If anyone has experience with the matter, help me out with these:

1. How do you correctly manage fatigue? say you have a lower body workout on monday and you have a running session on tuesday, how would you change volume/intensity of the workout on monday to accommodate the run on tuesday?
2. What is the ""best"" way of combining the two in terms of session frequency (3 days lifting, 3 days running etc..)
3. Could strength training directly impact running in terms of making it better/worse?
4. What are some general guidelines for programming for endurance ? (for example when you go to the gym you have prescribed reps and sets scheme and a weight you need to lift, how does it apply for endurance training?)
5. Would general strength training be better for endurance than training for powerlifting (since powerlifting is a very specific form of training)
6. What are some good books or reading material I could look into that discuss this topic?
7. What would be additional good information for me to know about the topic that I did not mention in the questions?

Some backgrounds:

I am 38 now and although I have trained from my college time but I was lack of proper knowledge and guide. Plus one military service (which is required by law in my country), 2 times of big injury, I have only been training hard and seriously in the recent 5\~6 years.

Anyway so far I am 5'5"" and 160 lbs body weight. My bench press has stuck for a long time. it went to 266lbs 2\~3 years ago and only grow to 277 means only 5 more kg in those 2 years, and I really really want to go to 130kg (289 lbs) and eventually 135kg (300 lbs). Recently I saw the Candito Advanced Bench Program (in case you need a detail program it is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/3p5xck/candito\_just\_released\_advanced\_bench\_program/](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/3p5xck/candito_just_released_advanced_bench_program/) ) and I want to give it a try, but there are few things I would like to ask before I jump into it:

1. the first 3 weeks ask for 2 isolation accessory for 3 sets x 20 reps, I know my max bench stuck in the middle so it is more likely I should focus on triceps. Does it mean those 2 isolation accessory should only be triceps exercises like dips, rope pushdown or skullcrusher...etc ?
2. My regular training is 6 days a week as: lower body (heavy squat light DL), upper body (heavy chest, light back and shoulder), core and cardio, lower body (heavy DL light squat), core and cardio, upper body (light chest, heavy back and shoulder). If I start the Candito program, should I try to maintain the same loading for lower body and core exercises? or should I minimize them to just only being able to hold them in the same level?
3. The 4th week looks the most difficult one, day 1 is like 85% weight for 3 reps x 10 sets, which I think I can do it, but it seems no way I can do another 3 reps x 10 sets straight followed in the next day. Does the ""day 1 day 2"" really means the a day and the next day? can I do it on like Monday and Wednesday?

1587245362,"Hi all, I've been working out for a year now, but recently decided to start lifting for numbers. I just turned 18 and am only 129 bodyweight. I was feeling warm and loose, and hit 145 on bench, highest I've ever gotten, tried for 150 next, failed that, spotter took it.

I decided to do some backdown sets to finish the workout and went down to 135, a weight that should have been moderate intensity, not easy, but not too hard. On the last 2 inches on the way down, super close to the bar touching my chest, I started to feel a non painful loose weakness dead center of my left pec, like it was on a stretchy thread about to get pulled 50 miles.

A weird feeling, like it was about to pull and stretch way more than it should have, and kind of felt loose and wiggly.

I have never felt this before, is it because I hit a pr, tried to hit another pr, and then do a heavy backdown right after? Did I just put way too much new stimulus in one session?

Im not pushing or pulling crazy numbers and am a newbie, so I didn't think I had to worry about muscle tears as much.

**Who here has had shoulder surgery (in particular to the bone, but soft tissue as well)? How long until you could lift at all? Was it different for squat, dead, and bench? How long until you were back to pre-op numbers? Were there any exercises/protocols you followed that you believed helped? Have some things never truly recovered? Do you have any gross surgery scars to share?**

SO...

Apparently my collarbone had been broken since the summer of 2012. Had two violent tackles playing club rugby, was diagnosed as a subluxation (temporary dislocation), as the xray showed no break, and was given PT to do. In all honestly, I wasn't very good at doing it. My shoulder was sore and a bit unstable, but didn't hurt all that much, except for occasional flare-ups.

Through rugby cross-training I found lifting! I'm way better at lifting, and I've been going to the gym several times a week since, and competing since 2015. I've gone to Canadian nationals a few times and in 2019 competed at IPF bench worlds!

I took a break from powerlifting after bench worlds cause my shoulders were so beat down. I started doing Oly so I could focus on a lighter, more technique-heavy goal. Eventually though, the pain in my shoulder got so bad I made an appointment with a sports med. He suspected a labral tear, or similar, so ordered me an MRI. Waited a few months (I'm in Canada, so there were wait times, but the only thing I had to pay for was parking!), finally got my MRI, and went back to the sports med a few weeks later. He was shocked, no one was expecting a full distal clavicle non-union fracture with separation and “sever bone marrow edema” (swelling) but no soft tissue damage. Made another appointment to consult the ortho surgeon, who confirmed that surgery was an option.

Next was a bit of a whirlwind: after accepting the surgical option, I was on the OR table within a month or so (March 6). Not what I was expecting given normal elective surgery wait times in my province. The surgeon used two arthroscopic ports to investigate the fracture, and was able to install an [ortho button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3tzP16HHFo) to hold my displaced clavicle down. In doing the investigation, they discovered that the CC ligaments were quite stretched, so the sliced me open and reconstructed those too. I now have two small scars and one long one over my shoulder.

The first 3 weeks pretty well sucked, but mostly due to lack of independence. Pain has been extremely mild and was only on drugs for a few days. I’m now 6weeks and a day post op and fully out of my sling as of yesterday. I was expecting to go to physio for manual manipulation for ROM and strengthening, but Rona shut everyone down. Been making due with youtube and hope. Was expecting to be able to go do leg presses and stuff and the commercial gym, but even that's not an option now :/

I had a 4 week check-up with my surgeon and got [imaging done](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-cUQ_HA-zC), which shows decent progress. My final check-up is May 20th, and I’m hoping my clavicle will show significant union and I’ll be cleared for cardio and light strength training. So far I don’t seem to have lost too much visible muscle mass in the affected arm, but we’ll see the real impacts when I’m finally allowed to get a pump.

I  understand that it's not very common for lifters to take this much time off, even with injury. If they do then they often don't train at all,  in comparison to training for aerobic exercise such as LD running.

I'm currently on my second experience and am looking to maximize it. To do my part I've been keeping tight notes and will share them after 6  months, in case someone else finds themselves in this situation.

Based on the first experience, I'd like to recover to full strength and  weight within 6 months. (S:172kg/B:125kg/D:255kg @ 84kg) compared to current  (S:100kg/B:75kg/D:150kg @ 74kg)

I’d like to use my privilege to help in some way and I’d like to call on others in this community to do the same if you can.

I’ve never put together a fund, so if anyone has experience with this please let me know. Otherwise, what I am proposing is a crowd funded pool of emergency money for small gym owners. There would be some sort of application process and the amount of money possible to distribute would depend on how many people we can get involved in this. This would not be a loan program, this money would be a no-strings grant to our in-need gym owners.

I'm 6'0"", 188 lb, and my current lifts are: S: 355 B: 225 D: 385

My squat has been my only lift to improve within the last 16 months largely because I was in a calorie deficit that entire time, and lost 30 lbs of body fat. I'm now in the middle of a light bulk and looking to increase these lifts.

I'm following a 12-week powerlifting program by Kizen Training (Omar Isuf, etc.) and the first thing I've noticed is how light the sessions are. Typically a workout only calls for 3-4 exercises. I'm very accustomed to doing 20-24 sets per muscle group, and burning out to exhaustion on most exercises.

I'm hoping this is allowed in this subreddit, with the quarantine going on I hope everybody is staying safe and healthy!

It's also a perfect time to work on imbalances or nagging injuries as well. I am a manual therapist and strength and conditioning coach that works with strength athletes (powerlifters, weightlifters, etc) and thought I'd devote some time helping others on this subreddit!

If you have any questions regarding your pain, injuries or anything related to form, I'd more more than happy to give you more information / point you in the right direction.

First time posting but a long time lurker! A lot of great info in here!

I’m blessed enough to have a home gym so my routine isn’t changing. However, I’ve programmed for myself loosely based off of starting strength for about six months (tbh, I’m not doing that program to the T because i just don’t want to squat every time I train).

I’m thinking about buying a Barbell Medicine training template and a nutrition coach.

Is a nutrition coach really that necessary or should I just experiment to see what works best for me?
