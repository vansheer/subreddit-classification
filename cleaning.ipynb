Don't take up valuable space on the front page and annoy the mods, ASK IT HERE and one of our resident \"experts\" will try and answer it. As long as its somehow related to powerlifting then nothing is too generic, too stupid, too awful, too obvious or too repetitive. And don't be shy, we don't bite (unless we're hungry), and no one will judge you because everyone had to start somewhere and we're more than happy to help newbie lifters out.\\n\\n#SO FIRE AWAY WITH YOUR DUMBNESS!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             33\n",

       " [I found some crazy good deals at Breakout Fitness. The website is www.xbreakoutfitness.com. I recently bought their portable blender that i use before every workout and a massage gun for a crazy cheap price under $100 that i use after every workout. They also have nice exercise equipments such as resistance bands and tube that i bought like 2 months ago. Im considering buying a back foam roller soon also that I recently saw. Their instagram is \"breakoutfitnessshop\". Good Luck !](https://xbreakoutfitness.com/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",
       "Hey everyone! Super random question. I recently got an echo bike and am in love with it. The phone holder is great for more intense workouts when all I need is music and need to skip or repeat songs. However, I was wondering if there was a way to mount my iPad through some diy or some 3rd party product for those lengthier times spent on the echo bike when I just want crank out a low-intensity, longer ride on it. Thanks in advance and sorry for this off-topic question, I just wasn't sure where else to ask for this product!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           2\n",
